I'm Brigitta, this is Gretl. And, uh, Emily and Richard are expecting us.<\/p>\n<p>LIESL: Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Rory walk inside; they hear Emily and Richard arguing upstairs.]<\/p>\n<p>LIESL: Uh, can I, uh, get you a drink?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You know what, that's okay. I can get it. Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?<\/p>\n<p>LIESL: Really? Thank you. [walks away]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What is going on?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know. I think George and Martha are joining us for dinner.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Rory watch Emily and Richard fighting on the steps.]<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I didn't know that my every conversation needed to be reported to you. I stand corrected.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I have been the co-chair of the Starlight Foundation for the last eight years.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I know this, Emily.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And the Black and White Ball is the main fundraising event of the season.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: It's one year.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: The co-chair cannot miss the main fundraising event.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Why? Won't the chair be there?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Is this a joke to you?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Emily, I have too many things to take care of at work. I don't have time for frivolous parties.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Frivolous parties? Friv. . . .[walks up the steps]<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Well, where are you going? Oh, come back here. [follows her]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow, this is bad.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know, I wish we had popcorn.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Shh. Incoming.<\/p>\n<p>[Emily and Richard come back down the steps. Emily reads from a stack of invitations.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: The Hartford Zoological Silent Auction, the Mark Twain House Restoration Fund luncheon, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Literacy Auction.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I can read those myself, you know.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: This is the fourth event you've taken upon yourself to turn down on our behalf. And I am on the board of all of those foundations. Now how do you think that makes me look?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Like your husband is busy and has a great deal of responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, I have responsibilities too.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I understand that your social engagements are important.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: They're not just social engagements.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Anything at which you serve tea is a social engagement.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That's it. I am gonna get a tape recorder so you can hear how pompous and condescending you sound.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Wha...uh...Emily.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: No, I wouldn't want you to take my word for it. I might be delirious from all that tea I've been drinking. [walks upstairs]<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Oh stop this. [follows her]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Maybe we should leave.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Are you kidding? We've got dinner theater here.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But Grandma and Grandpa are obviously in a fight.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: One that they probably wouldn't want us to see.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, we stumbled in here completely innocently. We came for dinner as usual, per their request. We had no idea we were walking into The Lion King without the puppet heads.<\/p>\n<p>[They come back downstairs. Emily follows Richard holding out a tape recorder.]<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Get that thing out of my face.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Just say the tea thing again.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: You are behaving like a child.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Turn around when you talk, would you? I'm not sure how good this microphone is.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: [sees Lorelai and Rory] Oh.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [claps] Brava! Encore! I'm sorry, does Terrence McNally know about you too? Get me the phone!<\/p>\n<p>[opening credits]<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LUKE'S DINER<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter. Lorelai is reading Rory's homework.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It sucks. I know it sucks, just tell me it sucks.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's great.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No it's not.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's an A.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Don't lie.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: A-plus.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're my mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Is anything higher than an A-plus?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You have to say that.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's an A-plus with a crown and a wand.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: This is not how you raise a child. You don't send them out there with a false sense of pride because out there, in the real world, no one will coddle you. I'd rather know right now if I'm gonna be working at CNN or carrying a basket around it's offices with sandwiches in it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's great.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Really?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Really really.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>[Luke walks over and fills their mugs.]<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Coffeecoffee. Okay, what do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What's the rush there, Zippy?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I'm just swamped this morning. I was supposed to have help but I don't. So order right now or I'm bringing the both of you an egg white omelet with a side of steamed spinach.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Pancakes.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: French toast.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Thank you. [Jess walks into the diner from the stairway] Jess, you were supposed to be down here. . . .what the hell is that?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: What?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: That.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: That is a shirt.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Change.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: What?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Go upstairs and change your shirt.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I like this shirt.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: How can you like that shirt?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: It brings out my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Hey, part of the deal of you staying here is that you work here, and when you work here you will wear proper work attire, and that is not proper work attire. Now go upstairs and change into something that won't scare the hell out of my customers.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke. [goes upstairs]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Gross shirt.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good band.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh yeah.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE<\/p>\n<p>[Emily is having tea on the back patio with three friends.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>MAID: Mm hmm. [walks away]<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: Another new one, Emily?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes. The last one only made it through one evening. Thoroughly nervous creature.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 2: What do you do to them, Em?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, the usual. Clean this, cook that, sacrifice a virgin on your way out.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: [laughs] The things you say.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 2: We could've done with some of that at the ball the other night.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Why, was it dull?<\/p>\n<p>LADY 2: I felt as if my shoes were going out of style as I sat there.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What a shame.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Now, Nattie, it wasn't all dull. Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: Oh, that's right.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What, what about Truly Bishop?<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Well, you know she and Eugene split up last month.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What?<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: Oh Em! You knew about that. They had this huge fight at the. . oh that's right, you missed the Schafer's cocktail party.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: They broke up at the Schafer's cocktail party?<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: He has another family in Salisbury.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: No!<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: She's 26, with a 2 year old.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: How did Truly find out?<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: The little tart sent her a letter.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh my God.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: So Truly confronted Eugene after consuming a bottle and a half of Cristal, and he admitted it. He said he was going to leave her and marry the Salisbury concubine.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What did she do?<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: She threw an ice sculpture at his head.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I can't believe I missed that.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: You've missed everything lately.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Yes, where have you been? Is everything all right?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes, it's just, uh, Richard.<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury, has he?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: No, he's been swamped at work. Night and day, weekends. You'd think he was the only person who worked at that company. Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well. His back and knees. Very bad knees. [Sees Rory at the patio doorway] Oh Rory, what a nice surprise.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hey Grandma. Sorry to butt in like this.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Nonsense, come and meet my friends. Ladies, I'd like you to meet my granddaughter Rory.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Well, hello Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Nice to meet you.<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: My goodness, what a pretty girl you are.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: The eyes.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: The nose.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: Walk around sweetie.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Sally, leave the girl alone.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: I just wanna see the walk. Lorelai had such a specific walk.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Fast.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: That was it.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Come, sit, would you like some tea?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, no. I just came to pick up a book that Grandpa was supposed to leave for me.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Go check his study. It might be on his desk.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, thanks. [walks inside]<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Emily, your granddaughter is just lovely. How old is she?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Sixteen.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Sixteen, that's a nice age.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: So, have you thought about her debut?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, uh, no, not yet.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Well you know, the Daughters of the Daughters of the American Revolution Debutante Ball is next week.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It is? I hadn't realized.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Why don't you present Rory there?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh. . uh. . Well, I don't know. Isn't it a little late?<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: Oh please. For Emily Gilmore, I'm sure they'll bend the rules.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: Oh you have to. With a girl like that Emily, you'll be the hit of the ball.<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: She'd definitely be the prettiest one there.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: Except for Katie Heathington.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: No, didn't you hear? Katie fell off her horse, has a scab on her face.<\/p>\n<p>NATTIE: Oh, well then, if Katie Heathington has a scab on her face, Rory will definitely be the prettiest one there.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 3: It'll be your crowning moment.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory returns with the book]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I found it. [pause] Yay.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table doing homework as Rory comes home.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm coming out.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Out of what?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Out into society.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What are you talking about?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I went to Grandma's house after school.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, right away, bad.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And, um, her DAR friends are all there and they're talking about this debutante ball that's being thrown.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh no.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And when I got back from Grandpa's office, they all invited me out onto the patio.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No no no, please tell me you did not go out onto the patio.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I went out onto the patio.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ugh, Rory, that's like accepting the position as the drummer in Spinal Tap.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Before I knew it, Grandma was telling me how important it is for a person to be properly presented to society.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ugh.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And how every young girl dreams of this day.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Agh.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And how there are flowers.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh Lord.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And music.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Please.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And cake.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh yeah, the cake's actually good.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And before I knew it, Grandma was bringing out your old dress and I was trying it on and. . . what are you doing?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm getting you out of this. [picks up phone]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom, wait.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I swear, there is nothing in the world my mother is better at than getting someone to agree to something that in any other universe, they would never ever consider.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I am still convinced she had something to do with Lily Tomlin doing that movie with John Travolta.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm doing this.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Why?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Because you should've seen the look on Grandma's face when she asked me. It's just really really important to her.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: But. . .<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Now if it's that important to her, and it's not that important to me, then why shouldn't I do it?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory, do you now what a coming out party says?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It says I'm a woman now.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No. It says, 'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding and marriageable age, and I will now parade around in front of young men of similarly good breeding and marriageable age so they can all take a good long look at me.'<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're exaggerating.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, it's like animals being up for bid at the county fair, except sheep don't wear hoop skirts.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Look, I promised, but you don't have to be apart of it if you don't want to.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, no, if you wanna do it, I'll help. It's just weird. This is all the stuff I ran away from. I just assumed you'd be running with me.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, I would, but I heard debutantes don't run. Something about the heels.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: All right then. If you're sure, where do we start? Uh, let's see. Well, you have a dress. You need a dowry, I guess. There you go. And uh, you'll need shoes, hose, gloves, some mice, a dog, a pumpkin. What's wrong?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, nothing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, no, it just says that your father is supposed to present you at the ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Whatever, it's no big deal. I can get someone else to do it. Grandpa probably.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Or Taylor.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Or the cable guy looked pretty friendly last week. Maybe he has a tux.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hand me the phone.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I was kidding about the cable guy. What are you doing?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [dials phone] Look missy, there are plenty of things that should weird you out about coming out, but inviting your father shouldn't be one of them.<\/p>\n<p>OPERATOR: The number you have dialed. . .<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Umm, wra. . . gum wrapper.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He's not going to come.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You don't know until you ask.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [dials new number] Look, we call, we ask, there's no harm. Trust me. Cable guy's not going anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Hello?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ugh, hi. Where the hell are you?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPER: Boston.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Boston? [walks into living room]<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, Boston. Baked Beans, cream pie, tea party, strangler.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, that Boston.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: And you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Me.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Where are you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Helsinki.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Really.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, I finally got the girl band together and after a week opening stateside, we headed across the Atlantic and now we're huge with the Nordic set.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: It's good to hear from you. We haven't talked in awhile.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You could've called too, you know. Or do you have one of those special phones that only receives calls?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, I figured you had a lot going on what with the engagement and the canceling of the engagement. How's that going, by the way?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, still canceled.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: You okay?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good. And I'm even better when I'm not talking about it.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Moving on then.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So I have some shocking news. Rory's coming out.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Out of what?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Coming out. White dresses, gloves, curtsies.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Stop it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I swear to God.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I can't believe you're letting her do it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, well, I wasn't about to let her use my method of getting out of it.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: This is crazy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: She's doing it as a favor to my mom, there's no talking her out of it.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, did you tell her about Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke, Gloria Vanderbilt?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, and she's perfectly willing to marry Cary Grant, get offed by her crazy butler and start designing blue jeans as soon as the ball ends.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, okay, if that's what she wants.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Now comes the reason for my phone call.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: All your regular 976 numbers are busy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Now I know this is totally not your thing, but as you will remember, part of the whole coming out process involves the girls being escorted around the dance floor by their Dads.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Ah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Now, I know you would rather sit through &quot;Endless Love&quot; than ever be apart of this scene again. But this is very important to your daughter and she has never asked you for anything, and although no one's keeping track, it would seem that your constant non-presence in her life and your lack of ever showing up when you say you're going to or calling when you say you're going to or basically doing anything when you say you're going to would tend to indicate that you owe her, big time. Now before you say no, I want you to take a minute and remember you have a great daughter who needs you and she has a mother who will hunt you down like a half-priced Kate Spade purse if you disappoint her.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I'm there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: By there, do you mean the Daughters of the American Revolution Annual Debutante Ball?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh Chris, please don't make this promise if you can't.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I wouldn't miss it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's next weekend.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I'll clear my schedule.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You swear?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Oh wait, next weekend?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Christopher!<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I'm kidding, I will definitely be there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, and in exchange for that I will refrain from saying the ten things that came to mind for making fun of your schedule.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Thanks.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Bye.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Bye.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory walks into living room]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey Little Debbie, your dad is definitely gonna be there.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're kidding!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, he's gonna walk you down the stairs, and turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy, and announce that Rory Gilmore is officially open for business.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I can't believe it. And he definitely said definitely?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Definitely.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So there's a fifty/fifty chance.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know. He sounded pretty sure, I'd say sixty/forty.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[Dean, Lane and Rory are on the couch watching TV while Lorelai walks around the living room talking on the telephone.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No Mom, I'm sure one crinolin will be plenty. No, she doesn't. I'm sure she doesn't. Yeah, in what scenario would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves, Mom? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant what scenario on my planet would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: So what?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It's good huh?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: It's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And doesn't Neil Young look cool?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I guess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Neil Young looks cool because he's Neil Young, not because he's wearing a tux.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I don't have to ask her mom 'cause I know the answer. I know the answer Mom, I know the answer. Yeah, no, okay, well I don't have to ask her MomHold on. Rory, would you like Grandma's hairstylist to come and set your hair before the ball? . . Oh, I did not coach her Mom, go back to talking about gloves.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I think you're gonna look great in a tux.<\/p>\n<p>LANE: Tails.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: What?<\/p>\n<p>LANE: Yeah, according to this it says that all escorts must be properly attired in black tails, white cumberbuns, and white gloves.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: What?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm sure the gloves are optional.<\/p>\n<p>LANE: Not according to this.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Tails? Gloves?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Remember Neil Young. Remember that you love me. Remember that I'll be watching BattleBots with you for a month.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Show me Neil Young again.<\/p>\n<p>[Horn honks from outside]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Dad!<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO OUTSIDE<\/p>\n<p>[Christopher is getting out of his car as Rory and Lorelai walk out the front door.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Dad! [runs to the car]<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Whoa! Hold it right there. A lady never runs out to meet a gentleman caller who hasn't been announced.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Sorry, we haven't tamed my wild ways yet.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Thank God I'm here now.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I missed you! [hugs him]<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Me too.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Hey.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What is this?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: What? Oh my God, where did this come from?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What happened to your bike?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: A crazy game of key exchange at the car wash.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: This is a car.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yes it is.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It has four wheels and a roof and airbags and seat belts and my God, it smells like a forest.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, I needed a little more space. Had something big to haul. I believe this belongs to you. [hands Rory a box from the trunk]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: The Compact Oxford English Dictionary!<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I promised you I'd get it. I'm just sorry it took so long.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's okay.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: On the bright side, this is the new edition. If I'd gotten you the old one, you wouldn't have the word 'jiggy' in it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you. I love it, I'm gonna go look things up right now.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Wait wait. [hands her magnifying glass]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thanks.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Go. [Rory goes inside]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That was really great of you.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. So back to mocking my car?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh yeah. A Volvo sedan, are you kidding?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: This is a great car.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: For driving to bingo.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, it just seemed like time. I couldn't keep showing up for work on my bike.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Work?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: You've heard of it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, but I didn't think you had.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, it took awhile. I kept getting it mixed up with nap, but I finally figured it out.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So, you bought a car and got a job?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Actually, job then car.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, 'cause it's more responsible that way.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Exactly.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Wow, so tell me about the job.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, I show up everyday, drink bad coffee, exchange lame pleasantries in the break room with Linda from marketing, and then at the end of two weeks they give me a paycheck. It's a pretty cool system.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You're serious?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, you know how us working types are. Get in.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well uh. . .I'm not supposed to take rides with strangers.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Trust me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, but only if you promise we won't go over 25 miles an hour on the motorway. [Lorelai gets in as Christopher blasts some music] Oh my God, George Lucas wishes he had this sound system.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I've got Alpine head units, two subs, and two twelves. In exchange, no passenger-side airbag.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah, so the old Christopher still lives.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory leans in the car window.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Could you please attenuate the cacophony out here?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Huh?<\/p>\n<p>[Rory reaches in and adjusts the volume]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Turn down the music. [goes back inside]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Next time instead of a dictionary, just slip her a crisp twenty.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Deal.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Emily walk through the front door carrying several shopping bags.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Twelve pairs of pantyhose.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It's going to be a long night. She's bound to have a run.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Twelve pairs.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: There's the presentation, the circle, the curtsy, the fan dance.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, there'd have to be a 12k run and a jujitsu demonstration for her to go through twelve pairs of pantyhose.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Does it really hurt to be prepared, Lorelai?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, Mom, it doesn't hurt to be prepared.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And the good news is, now she is prepared for her high school graduation, her college graduation, her marriage, three to five anniversaries, a hostess gig, and jury duty, especially if she's sequestered.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You make me tired.<\/p>\n<p>[Richard walks down the stairs.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh Richard, I didn't know you were home.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Yes, well, we learn something everyday.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You didn't have to work?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I am working.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey Dad, guess how many pairs of pantyhose we bought today?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I'd rather not, if you don't mind.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh Richard, I got you some beautiful new cufflinks for this weekend.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I already have cufflinks.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I know, but these have bulldogs on them. Come look.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I'll look at them later.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: All right, fine. Just remember to pick up your tux from the cleaners tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I won't have time.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It's right around the corner from your office.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I have to go in early tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, go now.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I am busy now.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Doing what?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Emily, I am not going to qualify my time with you. I am not going to pick up my tuxedo. You planned this ridiculous affair, you pick up my tuxedo. Or I simply don't have to go. Either one of these options is fine with me. [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey Mom, I might be reading too much into this, but um, is something going on between you and Dad?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What are you talking about?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know, he just seems a little less jolly than usual.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: He's just busy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: He seems upset.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, he's not.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You seem upset.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well I'm not. We're both fine.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, my mistake.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I better go pick up his tux.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO<\/p>\n<p>[Rory and Dean are practicing dancing.]<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Now, keep counting in your heads. Look each other in the eye. Dean, are you leading?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I have no idea.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Okay okay, stop stop stop. Now remember, one of the most important things in ballroom dancing is to remember to spot, otherwise you're gonna get dizzy. So, what you wanna do is you wanna pick out something to focus on. I usually like to find a lonely seaman. Then when turning, whip your head around and find your spot again. [spins around] Hello sailor, hello sailor, hello sailor. Now you try it.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You've gotta be kidding me.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I think you can do it without the 'hello sailor' part.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: BattleBots.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: For the rest of your life.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Now take it from the top.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory and Dean start dancing again as Lorelai and Christopher walk in with coffee.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, you guys are really improving. Now you're actually facing each other.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Anyone need a break?<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Okay, take five, but don't sit down because your muscles will get cold.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So how's it going?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Actually, I'm not very good.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, which is really holding me back because I'm a natural.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, maybe you just need a glittery glove and a really freaky face.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: At one point Miss Patty thought Dean was gonna get hurt, she made me sit in the corner and watch.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey! Nobody puts Baby in the corner.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: It's not your fault. Ballroom dancing is a wonderfully sexist thing. Any woman can do it, all she needs is a strong male lead. No offense Dean. [He pulls Lorelai towards him, but she stumbles.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, agh!<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Oh, well, most any woman can do it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready. I want a do over.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Fine. May I have this dance?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know. Do you have a trust fund? Always make sure.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Christopher start dancing. When they're done, Rory and Dean clap.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, I'm adopted.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, I'm never gonna be able to do that.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: No, you guys just need some practice.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Listen to your father, Rory. Your adorable, adorable father.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Come on, let's get you out of here before you become Patty's next husband.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: See you guys later. Bye Patty.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Oh, the way you toy with me.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO OUTSIDE<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Christopher walk out of the dance studio each holding a coffee cup.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Did you know you still knew how to do that?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I wish I didn't. Imagine what we could do if we freed up the brain space that holds onto the Vianese Waltz.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, it's right up there in between old Brady Bunch reruns and the lyrics to Rapture.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Ooh, I gotta say, this isn't like the chai lattes in Boston.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, well, expecting Luke to make a chai anything was completely insane.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he just threw a cinnamon stick in some tea.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm pretty sure it's not a cinnamon stick.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Okay, throwing this out now.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So chai latte, when did that happen?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I don't know. Everyone at work drinks them.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Huh. Well, since you still haven't told me what exactly it is that you do, I'm gonna go with yoga instructor or chiropractor.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: No, it's actually pretty interesting. I'm working for this firm that helps those overblown tech companies scale back and stay afloat now that they're facing leaner times.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm sorry, uh, what's the interesting part?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: We dress like superheroes when we do it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, nice. So how long do you think you'll be able to keep this going?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm pretty happy there. I'd say at least 'til Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, so long term.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: You know, it's weird. I always hated the idea of having to be somewhere at a specific time day after day, but as it turns out, I like the stability.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Really?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. I like that at the end of the day, I feel like I've done something. I've earned something.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I think that's really great.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Only took me ten years and several failed business ventures to figure out what I wanted.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Which is?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Not my parents' life.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Something you figured out at sixteen.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Actually, six months, but I just couldn't vocalize it yet.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, you knew what you wanted, you went out and got it. I was always a little jealous of you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, you seem to be catching up. We did good.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Well, I did good. The fact that she can't follow a lead is all you.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[Rory sits on the couch painting her toenails, Christopher helps Dean tie his bowtie, Lorelai walks around with a book on her head eating Chinese food.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: See now, only a lady can gracefully walk around a room with a book on her head while eating Kung Pao chicken. And a great lady can even spit the peanuts back into the container without anyone noticing.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, well, don't be intimidated. You have to practice and practice to get to my level.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Anyone want the last eggroll?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Uh, no.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Heh. Where are you going?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: To get the eggroll.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You're getting the eggroll yourself?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No! Ladies never get their own eggrolls. Ladies never get their own anything. They don't even get their own ideas.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh boy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: They just sit helplessly and wait for some young strong man to come by and assist them. They don't step in puddles, they don't step over puddles. They can't even look at puddles. They actually need to be blindfolded and thrown in a sack and carried over puddles.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Isn't there a moratorium on how long ladies are supposed to talk?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Uhh, no. Now repeat after me, I am completely helpless.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so you pull the left side through the back loop and tug a little bit on both sides, and you my friend, might just be mistaken for a gentleman. Or a waiter.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: So, how do you know how to do this?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Seventeen cotillions, a dozen debutante balls, and a brief but scarring experiment with the Children of the American Revolution.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Where you wore nothing but the bowtie.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: A good idea on conception, but the sudden snowstorm instantly dampened the effect.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Hey, uh, do you think it's cool when Neil Young wears a tux?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, of course, but it's Neil Young.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: All right. I should get going. I'll see you at three.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay. Oh wait. [hands him a box]<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: What's this?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Your gloves.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I thought you were kidding.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No no. Ladies never kid.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Bye. [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Bye.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I think I'm going to bed too.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Do you need help?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Wrong! The correct answer is yes. Ladies need help with everything.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Goodnight.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [sighs]<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Night.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Night.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know about that girl. I don't know how she's ever gonna make it in society. At this rate, she's gonna actually get a job and only marry once.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: You calling your mom again?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't get it. For the last week, every five minutes she's calling me checking on shoe fittings and curtsy progress, and have I talked Rory into putting her hair up yet, and then tonight, nothing.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm sure they had a lot of getting ready to do for themselves tonight.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: She's been acting so weird lately. They're fighting. Openly fighting. I don't think they've ever done that before. I'm not sure what to do about it.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Move to California. That's what I do when my parents fight.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You know, my father doesn't even want to go tomorrow. His perfect angle granddaughter is being presented to society in front of all his friends and colleagues, something he never got to do with his bad, loser, evil daughter.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Maybe you should talk to them. I'm sorry, was that me that said that? I must've had an aneurysm.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, nothing more I can do tonight. I'm gonna head up to bed. Do you want me to turn off the lights?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to stay up and do a little work tonight.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai laughs]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that's not a joke anymore.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Goodnight.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BALLROOM<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Rory arrive at the ballroom.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow, this place is huge. Do I have to walk down those stairs?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, I'm afraid so. Unless you wanna make a really memorable entrance and just sliiide down the banister. Which I totally encourage, by the way.<\/p>\n<p>LADY: You are<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Lorelai Gilmore.<\/p>\n<p>LADY: Late.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sorry, my fault. Took me awhile to get pretty. Not all of us are sixteen anymore, you know what I mean? No.<\/p>\n<p>LADY: You are to head up the stairs. The preparation room is on the right.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Look for the toxic cloud of Chanel and Final Net.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory starts walking towards the stairs. She looks back at Lorelai.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [mouths] Sliiide.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO PREPARATION ROOM<\/p>\n<p>[Rory and the lady enter the room. Other girls are walking around getting dressed and doing their makeup.]<\/p>\n<p>LADY: Hang your dress there, put your makeup on over there. You'll have to make do with a non-lighted mirror. The lighted ones went to the girls that were here before dawn. Listen up ladies, everyone must be beautiful and ready to go by 7:30.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory sits down at a mirror. She talks to the girl next to her.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I can't believe we have an hour and a half.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: I know, I am never gonna be ready in time. God only knows if the swelling on my nose is gonna go down. I had to go and inherit my father's nose. I'm Libby.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Rory.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Uh, which one should I wear? I've thought about this all month, and I cannot decide.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, well, that's a tough one.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: I know. This is red red, and this is orange red. The wrong one and I will end up looking like a hooker. Or a teacher.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's a lot of pressure.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: The two minutes you are standing on those stairs tonight will determine the social status for the rest of your life.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow, what if you trip? I mean, not that you would. You wouldn't. I might. Probably will actually. Could be a real Cirque du Soleil kind of night.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: You should not even joke about stuff like that. Ow. There's a head under there, you know.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BALLROOM<\/p>\n<p>[The bartender hands Lorelai a drink.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You are a wonderful, wonderful man. I have a feeling we're going to be very close tonight. [sees Emily] Hmm. Mom, you're here.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Where should I be, Spain?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh. I tried calling you all night last night.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I was very busy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And then we got here before you.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What is your point, Lorelai?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Nothing. It's just weird.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, I'm here now, so it's not weird anymore. Look at these flowers. Baby's breath. What is this, County General?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You look very nice Mom. I like your dress.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Cotton tablecloths, folding chairs. It's not supposed to be like this. In my day, people sat in real chairs.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, what's the matter?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I wanted my granddaughter to be presented to society in a beautiful elegant ballroom, not a Shakey's.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: The room is beautiful Mom. You're being too critical.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: There's Nan. I'm going to have a little talk with her about the proper height for a taper.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO PREPARATION ROOM<\/p>\n<p>[Rory is sitting down reading when Libby walks over to her holding a flask.]<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Midori sour?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, no thanks.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: More for me. At my last coming out, I shared with this girl who couldn't handle her booze. Neon green puke all over her white dress.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Your last coming out?<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Oh, this is my fifth one this year.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: You know, they say four out of five debs marry their escorts.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Kind of like the dentists with Trident.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Well I figure, five coming out balls, five escorts, one of them has to stick, right?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Good logic.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: So, is your escort the one?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: The one what?<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: The one you're gonna marry.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, well<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Is he cute?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes, he is very cute but<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Where are you guys planning to live when you get married?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, hold on a second.<\/p>\n<p>[Another girl walks over]<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Katie, hi. Too bad about your face.<\/p>\n<p>KATIE: Is it horrible?<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: No, you can hardly tell. Just walk sideways.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BALLROOM<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai is standing with some women.]<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: These things will be the death of me.<\/p>\n<p>LADY 2: Oh I know. And we've had no time to prep. Janet just got out of Rainbow Hills two days ago.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rehab?<\/p>\n<p>LADY 1: Fat farm.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah.<\/p>\n<p>[Christopher walks up to Lorelai]<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Hi, sorry to interrupt. Could you come with me? My cumberbun and I aren't seeing eye to eye.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Men, totally helpless. Excuse me.<\/p>\n<p>[They walk away from the women]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You saved me. I love you. I wanna have your baby. Oops, too late.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I saw the look. Same one you had that time you ended up on homecoming court.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ugh, someone's idea of a sick, sick joke. Hey, by the way, Neil Young's got nothing on you.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>[Emily walks over to them]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Lorelai, have you seen your father?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Uh, no.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: He promised me he'd be here by now.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Wait, you didn't come together?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I swear, if he misses this<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, Mom, did you call him?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes I called him. Of course I called him. I wouldn't go this long without calling him.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Emily, he's here.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Where? [he points to him] Oh. [walks to Richard] Richard, where have you been?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Where have I been?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes, where have you been?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I'm here, aren't I?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I can't look. Did she beat him with the baby's breath?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: No, they're just energetically practicing their sign language.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh God.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I think this is a really good time for a martini. Hello. Thirsty people here. [Lorelai goes behind the bar] Ah, what are you doing?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Steve won't mind.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Little tip. Never a good idea to let people know you're on a first name basis with the bartender. Wow, this is really something.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: You and I together at a debutante ball.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Huh, yeah.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Just like it would've been sixteen years ago.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Fancy dress.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Sneaking booze.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Parents acting crazy.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: You look great.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm so glad you're here.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: So am I.<\/p>\n<p>ANNOUNCER: All fathers please report to the debutante staging area upstairs. Fathers to the staging area.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Showtime. You gonna be all right?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Absolutely.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I'll see you later.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Curtsy pretty.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO STAGING AREA<\/p>\n<p>[Rory's waiting in line. Dean walks up to her.]<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Hey. I just wanted to see you before you became a proper lady of society.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So what do you think?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I think you look like a cotton ball.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why, thank you Jeeves.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: But a really cute cotton ball.<\/p>\n<p>[Libby walks up to Rory.]<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: Oh my God, is this your escort?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, it is.<\/p>\n<p>LIBBY: You are totally getting married.

[leaves]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Last chance to shimmy down the drainpipe.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Do me a favor?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Anything.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Just don't let me fall.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Right back at ya.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BALLROOM [The ball begins as a lady addresses the audience from a podium on the staircase. Lorelai sits at a table; Emily and Richard stand near the bar.]<\/p>\n<p>LADY AT PODIUM: Good evening. On behalf of the Daughters of the American Revolution, I would like to welcome you to our annual debutante ball. Oh this brings back so many memories. I myself came out in this very hall in nineteenwell, let's just say, a number of years ago. Now the word debutante comes from the French word debuter, which means to lead off. . .[fades into background]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Just come sit down.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I am going to finish my drink.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You won't be happy until you've spoiled this entire evening, will you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Um, guys, hi, there's a lady up there with a rock the size of Neptune around her neck talking about the debutantes of ancient Greece. It's a lot easier to fall asleep if you're sitting down, trust me.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I will sit down when I'm ready to sit down.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Richard, lower your voice.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: No, I will not lower my voice. I paid a fortune to be here, and I will speak just as loudly as I like.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You're embarrassing us. You're embarrassing Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Embarrassing Rory? This wasn't Rory's idea. This was your idea. This whole ridiculous evening was your idea, Emily.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You don't want your granddaughter presented to society?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: To hell with society. [people look at him] Yes, I'm talking about you!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Come on, that's it.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai leads them into another room]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Are you two completely out of your mind? There is a ceremony going on in there. Young girls in ugly dresses and stupid fans are parading around in circles for God knows what reason, and you two are ruining it.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I didn't want to come here. You knew I didn't want to come here.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, that's too bad. We have a social responsibility Richard.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I am so tired of hearing you say that.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: People expect us to be certain places and do certain things and we can't just withdraw from all of that.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Do you know what I'm going through at work?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Your whole life isn't that damn company, Richard.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I have told you what I'm going through, but somehow, you just don't seem to hear it. You don't listen to me. You don't listen to anybody.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That is not true.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: It is true. Isn't it true? Has she ever listened to a word you've said?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, well, hey, people listen in different ways, right? I mean, some people listen with their ears, and some people listen with not their ears, but that doesn't mean some actual listening hasn't happened in some form.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I have listened to you Richard. I know exactly what is going on with you.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Really, what?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You lost an account.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: No, I didn't lose an account. I was taken off an account. I was taken off an account that I personally brought into this company ten years ago.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: There are other accounts, Richard.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I have been in charge of that account for ten years!<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: How can you be so angry? Yes, they took you off that account, but they also gave you a promotion.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Oh, Emily.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You said they moved you upstairs to a larger office and gave you a new title and a better parking space.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Emily, dammit, I am being phased out.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You are not.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: What do you mean I'm not? I know whether I'm being phased out. I invented phased out for this company. Don't you think I did the exact same thing to Alan Parker?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Alan Parker retired.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Alan Parker was phased out. I now have his office, I now have his parking space. Do you know what happens from here? I lose more accounts, slowly but surely. They will put a younger man on them with me to be trained by the best. And then, one day they'll call and ask me to let that young man take a meeting without me, just to see how fast he's learning, and then suddenly that young man is given that account. And this happens again and again and again until I'm nothing, but a symbolic figurehead that they roll out for banquets and group pictures. And then one day, Emily, I will be asked to leave.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, so what?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Excuse me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Dad, I don't think Mom meant exactly<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: So what if that's true?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Or maybe she did.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: There are other options.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I don't want other options. I want to get up every morning and put on my suit, and go to my office, and do my work, like I've done everyday for the past thirty years. That's what I want to do. That's the only thing I want to do.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory leans into the hallway.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Um, excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt, but I'm next.<\/p>\n<p>[They walk back into the ballroom]<\/p>\n<p>LADY AT PODIUM: Elizabeth Dotie, daughter of George Edward Dotie the fourth, and Elenor Dotie. [pause] Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Christopher Hayden and Lorelai Gilmore.<\/p>\n<p>[Christopher and Rory walk down the stairs as Dean waits at the bottom. Christopher kisses Rory's hand, Rory curtsies, Christopher walks away, Dean walks Rory down the aisle.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That should've been you up there. Nothing's turning out the way it was supposed to. [walks away]<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO STARS HOLLOW<\/p>\n<p>[Later that night, Lorelai, Christopher, Rory, and Dean walk down the sidewalk.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So did you know that you're considered a hot Dad?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hah!<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Really?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Libby said that it's too bad you're my real Dad because if you were my stepdad, I could steal you away from mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ugh.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: That Libby's got a good life ahead of her.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I was very proud of all of you. You made it through the entire ceremony with a completely straight face. Almost all of you.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry, but that fan dance was more than I could take.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, I need a burger.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Me too. Dean?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Honestly, the only thing I can think of is taking off this tux.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, watch it, you're talking to a lady now.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Well, how about if I do it at home?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Better.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thanks again for going with me.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Tomorrow you start paying. Bye. [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Bye. And then there were three.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to get back to Boston first thing in the morning so I'm gonna call it a night too.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What? Not even time for fries?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I'll tell you what. I'll get up a little early and have coffee with you before I go. Deal?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Deal.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Honey, go ahead and order for us. I'll be there in a sec.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay. [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I just wanted to tell you how amazing you were tonight. Really, you completely came through for her.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: She deserves it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I haven't always given you a lot of credit in the past, but I'm giving you credit now. Big credit. Major credit. Buy yourself a sofa.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Thanks. I will.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You know, um, I happened to be looking through some old maps this afternoon and I couldn't help but notice that Boston is not that far away.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Aw, you needed a map to tell you that?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I also noticed that that, um, I-84 is a very good road. Solid, paved.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Uh huh.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And I put this information in my pretty little head, I was thinking, if you wanted to maybe drop by occasionally, it wouldn't be too difficult.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: You realize I'll be driving the Volvo?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Actually, I'm coming around to the Vovlo.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Really?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes. I think it's sort of a Catholic schoolgirl thing, you know? It's conservative on the outside, bad on the inside.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I like that image.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I've also heard the I-84 can get jammed on the weekends.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: It can.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So if you wanted to stay a little longer, just to avoid the traffic, it might be a good idea. I mean, Rory would definitely love it, and I wouldn't mind either. CHRISTOPHER: That is a tempting offer, but I really have to get back.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: To work?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: To workand to someone.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: I know I should've told you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh no, that's fine. That's totally your business.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: No, I meant to, butLor, it's just that you and I are so connected and...<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Chris, please, I get it. I think it's really great, I really do.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So who is it? Ooh, let me guess. Linda from marketing got to you, didn't she?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Her name is Sherri.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sherri from marketing?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Sherri from Boston.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah, hence the move.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Is it serious?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: It's getting there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Seeing you in just a bowtie serious?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: We're living together.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Wow, you really have changed.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well, Sherri made it pretty clear that I was gonna lose her if I didn't start getting it together, so...<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, well if you find a girl who's good with dating a square in a Volvo, you do what it takes to keep her.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Okay, uh, so I'll. . .I'll see you back home.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes you will.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LUKE'S DINER<\/p>\n<p>[Rory is about to bite into her burger as Lorelai walks in.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [gasps] Hey!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: After all you've been through tonight and I come in here and find you eating like that.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory raises her pinkie]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: There you go.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Being a lady is hard.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So tonight, what's the consensus?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: The fan dance was humiliating, I'm never doing a curtsy again, but having Dad around was great.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, it was.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He's got a new girlfriend, you know.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sherri.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Poor girl's named after a Journey song, that's gotta be rough.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He seems happy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: He does. He really does.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm glad.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Me too.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I feel kind of bad for Grandma though. She was so into this night and then she ended up being so miserable.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Don't worry. She'll have more fun at the next one.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Excuse me?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, we have you signed up for the next six balls.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Not funny.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, you're doing this until you bring home a prize.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Ignoring you now.<\/p>\n<p>[Luke brings Lorelai her burger.]<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: So, back from the ball huh?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, I left behind a glass slipper and a business card in case the prince is really dumb.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Good and desperate thinking.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thank you. Hmm, Luke.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What?<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai nods towards Jess, who is wiping down the counter dressed like Luke, complete with flannel shirt and backwards baseball cap. Luke walks over to him.]<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What do you think you're doing?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Working.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: So you think this is funny, huh?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I'm sorry. I thought this was the uniform.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Okay, you know what, that's fine. Have your little joke, you know. It doesn't bother me at all. You just go over there and clean off that table, okay? I'm ignoring you. You do not exist.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Okay.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: That's it, get upstairs and change.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: It's Luke, just Luke. Mister Luke. In fact, don't address me at all.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You know, I'm really lucky.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, why?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I have someone to complain to when life sucks or work sucks or just everything sucks. I have someone I can talk to.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, who?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh Shecky, you k*ll me. It just must be really lonely not to have that.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Are you thinking about Grandma?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm just. . .thinking.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE<\/p>\n<p>[Emily is gardening on the back patio as Lorelai walks out the back door.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What are you doing here?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, nothing much. I had a little time before my business class and I thought, 'Hey, why don't I just go over to Mom's house and just hang.'<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Just what?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Just hang, you know. Hang out. Talk, don't talk, whatever. Just hang.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So you're gardening, huh?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay. Well, don't let me stop you.

Lawrence\ntranscript by Stacy\nOPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[The doorbell rings, the maid answers it; Lorelai and Rory are standing there.]\nMAID: Yes?\nLORELAI: Hey.\nMAID: Hello.\nLORELAI: You're new.\nMAID: Uh, I started yesterday.\nLORELAI: What's your name?\nMAID: Liesl.\nLORELAI: Okay, Liesl. I'm Brigitta, this is Gretl. And, uh, Emily and Richard are expecting us.\nLIESL: Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.\n[Lorelai and Rory walk inside; they hear Emily and Richard arguing upstairs.]\nLIESL: Uh, can I, uh, get you a drink?\nLORELAI: You know what, that's okay. I can get it. Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?\nLIESL: Really? Thank you. [walks away]\nRORY: What is going on?\nLORELAI: I don't know. I think George and Martha are joining us for dinner.\n[Lorelai and Rory watch Emily and Richard fighting on the steps.]\nRICHARD: I didn't know that my every conversation needed to be reported to you. I stand corrected.\nEMILY: I have been the co-chair of the Starlight Foundation for the last eight years.\nRICHARD: I know this, Emily.\nEMILY: And the Black and White Ball is the main fundraising event of the season.\nRICHARD: It's one year.\nEMILY: The co-chair cannot miss the main fundraising event.\nRICHARD: Why? Won't the chair be there?\nEMILY: Is this a joke to you?\nRICHARD: Emily, I have too many things to take care of at work. I don't have time for frivolous parties.\nEMILY: Frivolous parties? Friv. . . .[walks up the steps]\nRICHARD: Well, where are you going? Oh, come back here. [follows her]\nRORY: Wow, this is bad.\nLORELAI: I know, I wish we had popcorn.\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: Shh. Incoming.\n[Emily and Richard come back down the steps. Emily reads from a stack of invitations.]\nEMILY: The Hartford Zoological Silent Auction, the Mark Twain House Restoration Fund luncheon, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Literacy Auction.\nRICHARD: I can read those myself, you know.\nEMILY: This is the fourth event you've taken upon yourself to turn down on our behalf. And I am on the board of all of those foundations. Now how do you think that makes me look?\nRICHARD: Like your husband is busy and has a great deal of responsibility.\nEMILY: Well, I have responsibilities too.\nRICHARD: I understand that your social engagements are important.\nEMILY: They're not just social engagements.\nRICHARD: Anything at which you serve tea is a social engagement.\nEMILY: That's it. I am gonna get a tape recorder so you can hear how pompous and condescending you sound.\nRICHARD: Wha...uh...Emily.\nEMILY: No, I wouldn't want you to take my word for it. I might be delirious from all that tea I've been drinking. [walks upstairs]\nRICHARD: Oh stop this. [follows her]\nRORY: Maybe we should leave.\nLORELAI: Are you kidding? We've got dinner theater here.\nRORY: But Grandma and Grandpa are obviously in a fight.\nLORELAI: Yeah?\nRORY: One that they probably wouldn't want us to see.\nLORELAI: Hey, we stumbled in here completely innocently. We came for dinner as usual, per their request. We had no idea we were walking into The Lion King without the puppet heads.\n[They come back downstairs. Emily follows Richard holding out a tape recorder.]\nRICHARD: Get that thing out of my face.\nEMILY: Just say the tea thing again.\nRICHARD: You are behaving like a child.\nEMILY: Turn around when you talk, would you? I'm not sure how good this microphone is.\nRICHARD: [sees Lorelai and Rory] Oh.\nEMILY: What?\nLORELAI: [claps] Brava! Encore! I'm sorry, does Terrence McNally know about you too? Get me the phone!\n[opening credits]\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter. Lorelai is reading Rory's homework.]\nRORY: It sucks. I know it sucks, just tell me it sucks.\nLORELAI: It's great.\nRORY: No it's not.\nLORELAI: It's an A.\nRORY: Don't lie.\nLORELAI: A-plus.\nRORY: You're my mom.\nLORELAI: Is anything higher than an A-plus?\nRORY: You have to say that.\nLORELAI: It's an A-plus with a crown and a wand.\nRORY: This is not how you raise a child. You don't send them out there with a false sense of pride because out there, in the real world, no one will coddle you. I'd rather know right now if I'm gonna be working at CNN or carrying a basket around it's offices with sandwiches in it.\nLORELAI: Rory.\nRORY: Yeah?\nLORELAI: It's great.\nRORY: Really?\nLORELAI: Really really.\nRORY: Thank you.\n[Luke walks over and fills their mugs.]\nLUKE: Coffeecoffee. Okay, what do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?\nLORELAI: What's the rush there, Zippy?\nLUKE: I'm just swamped this morning. I was supposed to have help but I don't. So order right now or I'm bringing the both of you an egg white omelet with a side of steamed spinach.\nLORELAI: Pancakes.\nRORY: French toast.\nLUKE: Thank you. [Jess walks into the diner from the stairway] Jess, you were supposed to be down here. . . .what the hell is that?\nJESS: What?\nLUKE: That.\nJESS: That is a shirt.\nLUKE: Change.\nJESS: What?\nLUKE: Go upstairs and change your shirt.\nJESS: I like this shirt.\nLUKE: How can you like that shirt?\nJESS: It brings out my eyes.\nLUKE: Hey, part of the deal of you staying here is that you work here, and when you work here you will wear proper work attire, and that is not proper work attire. Now go upstairs and change into something that won't scare the hell out of my customers.\nJESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke. [goes upstairs]\nLORELAI: Gross shirt.\nRORY: Yeah.\nLORELAI: Good band.\nRORY: Oh yeah.\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Emily is having tea on the back patio with three friends.]\nEMILY: Thank you.\nMAID: Mm hmm. [walks away]\nLADY 1: Another new one, Emily?\nEMILY: Yes. The last one only made it through one evening. Thoroughly nervous creature.\nLADY 2: What do you do to them, Em?\nEMILY: Oh, the usual. Clean this, cook that, sacrifice a virgin on your way out.\nLADY 1: [laughs] The things you say.\nLADY 2: We could've done with some of that at the ball the other night.\nEMILY: Why, was it dull?\nLADY 2: I felt as if my shoes were going out of style as I sat there.\nEMILY: What a shame.\nLADY 3: Now, Nattie, it wasn't all dull. Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?\nNATTIE: Oh, that's right.\nEMILY: What, what about Truly Bishop?\nLADY 3: Well, you know she and Eugene split up last month.\nEMILY: What?\nNATTIE: Oh Em! You knew about that. They had this huge fight at the. . oh that's right, you missed the Schafer's cocktail party.\nEMILY: They broke up at the Schafer's cocktail party?\nNATTIE: He has another family in Salisbury.\nEMILY: No!\nLADY 3: She's 26, with a 2 year old.\nEMILY: How did Truly find out?\nNATTIE: The little tart sent her a letter.\nEMILY: Oh my God.\nLADY 1: So Truly confronted Eugene after consuming a bottle and a half of Cristal, and he admitted it. He said he was going to leave her and marry the Salisbury concubine.\nEMILY: What did she do?\nLADY 1: She threw an ice sculpture at his head.\nEMILY: I can't believe I missed that.\nLADY 1: You've missed everything lately.\nLADY 3: Yes, where have you been? Is everything all right?\nEMILY: Yes, it's just, uh, Richard.\nNATTIE: He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury, has he?\nEMILY: No, he's been swamped at work. Night and day, weekends. You'd think he was the only person who worked at that company. Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well. His back and knees. Very bad knees. [Sees Rory at the patio doorway] Oh Rory, what a nice surprise.\nRORY: Hey Grandma. Sorry to butt in like this.\nEMILY: Nonsense, come and meet my friends. Ladies, I'd like you to meet my granddaughter Rory.\nLADY 3: Well, hello Rory.\nRORY: Nice to meet you.\nNATTIE: My goodness, what a pretty girl you are.\nLADY 1: She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?\nNATTIE: The eyes.\nLADY 3: The nose.\nLADY 1: Walk around sweetie.\nEMILY: Sally, leave the girl alone.\nLADY 1: I just wanna see the walk. Lorelai had such a specific walk.\nLADY 3: Fast.\nLADY 1: That was it.\nEMILY: Come, sit, would you like some tea?\nRORY: Oh, no. I just came to pick up a book that Grandpa was supposed to leave for me.\nEMILY: Go check his study. It might be on his desk.\nRORY: Okay, thanks. [walks inside]\nLADY 3: Emily, your granddaughter is just lovely. How old is she?\nEMILY: Sixteen.\nLADY 3: Sixteen, that's a nice age.\nLADY 1: So, have you thought about her debut?\nEMILY: Oh, uh, no, not yet.\nLADY 3: Well you know, the Daughters of the Daughters of the American Revolution Debutante Ball is next week.\nEMILY: It is? I hadn't realized.\nLADY 3: Why don't you present Rory there?\nEMILY: Oh. . uh. . Well, I don't know. Isn't it a little late?\nLADY 1: Oh please. For Emily Gilmore, I'm sure they'll bend the rules.\nLADY 3: Oh you have to. With a girl like that Emily, you'll be the hit of the ball.\nNATTIE: She'd definitely be the prettiest one there.\nLADY 1: Except for Katie Heathington.\nLADY 3: No, didn't you hear? Katie fell off her horse, has a scab on her face.\nNATTIE: Oh, well then, if Katie Heathington has a scab on her face, Rory will definitely be the prettiest one there.\nLADY 3: It'll be your crowning moment.\n[Rory returns with the book]\nRORY: I found it. [pause] Yay.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN\n[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table doing homework as Rory comes home.]\nRORY: I'm coming out.\nLORELAI: Out of what?\nRORY: Out into society.\nLORELAI: What are you talking about?\nRORY: I went to Grandma's house after school.\nLORELAI: Okay, right away, bad.\nRORY: And, um, her DAR friends are all there and they're talking about this debutante ball that's being thrown.\nLORELAI: Oh no.\nRORY: And when I got back from Grandpa's office, they all invited me out onto the patio.\nLORELAI: No no no, please tell me you did not go out onto the patio.\nRORY: I went out onto the patio.\nLORELAI: Ugh, Rory, that's like accepting the position as the drummer in Spinal Tap.\nRORY: Before I knew it, Grandma was telling me how important it is for a person to be properly presented to society.\nLORELAI: Ugh.\nRORY: And how every young girl dreams of this day.\nLORELAI: Agh.\nRORY: And how there are flowers.\nLORELAI: Oh Lord.\nRORY: And music.\nLORELAI: Please.\nRORY: And cake.\nLORELAI: Oh yeah, the cake's actually good.\nRORY: And before I knew it, Grandma was bringing out your old dress and I was trying it on and. . . what are you doing?\nLORELAI: I'm getting you out of this. [picks up phone]\nRORY: Mom, wait.\nLORELAI: I swear, there is nothing in the world my mother is better at than getting someone to agree to something that in any other universe, they would never ever consider.\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: I am still convinced she had something to do with Lily Tomlin doing that movie with John Travolta.\nRORY: I'm doing this.\nLORELAI: Why?\nRORY: Because you should've seen the look on Grandma's face when she asked me. It's just really really important to her.\nLORELAI: But. . .\nRORY: Now if it's that important to her, and it's not that important to me, then why shouldn't I do it?\nLORELAI: Rory, do you now what a coming out party says?\nRORY: It says I'm a woman now.\nLORELAI: No. It says, 'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding and marriageable age, and I will now parade around in front of young men of similarly good breeding and marriageable age so they can all take a good long look at me.'\nRORY: You're exaggerating.\nLORELAI: No, it's like animals being up for bid at the county fair, except sheep don't wear hoop skirts.\nRORY: Look, I promised, but you don't have to be apart of it if you don't want to.\nLORELAI: No, no, if you wanna do it, I'll help. It's just weird. This is all the stuff I ran away from. I just assumed you'd be running with me.\nRORY: Well, I would, but I heard debutantes don't run. Something about the heels.\nLORELAI: All right then. If you're sure, where do we start? Uh, let's see. Well, you have a dress. You need a dowry, I guess. There you go. And uh, you'll need shoes, hose, gloves, some mice, a dog, a pumpkin. What's wrong?\nRORY: Oh, nothing.\nLORELAI: Rory.\nRORY: Oh, no, it just says that your father is supposed to present you at the ceremony.\nLORELAI: Oh.\nRORY: Whatever, it's no big deal. I can get someone else to do it. Grandpa probably.\nLORELAI: Rory.\nRORY: Or Taylor.\nLORELAI: Okay.\nRORY: Or the cable guy looked pretty friendly last week. Maybe he has a tux.\nLORELAI: Hand me the phone.\nRORY: I was kidding about the cable guy. What are you doing?\nLORELAI: [dials phone] Look missy, there are plenty of things that should weird you out about coming out, but inviting your father shouldn't be one of them.\nOPERATOR: The number you have dialed. . .\nLORELAI: Umm, wra. . . gum wrapper.\nRORY: He's not going to come.\nLORELAI: You don't know until you ask.\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: [dials new number] Look, we call, we ask, there's no harm. Trust me. Cable guy's not going anywhere.\nCHRISTOPHER: Hello?\nLORELAI: Ugh, hi. Where the hell are you?\nCHRISTOPER: Boston.\nLORELAI: Boston? [walks into living room]\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah, Boston. Baked Beans, cream pie, tea party, strangler.\nLORELAI: Oh, that Boston.\nCHRISTOPHER: And you?\nLORELAI: Me.\nCHRISTOPHER: Where are you?\nLORELAI: Helsinki.\nCHRISTOPHER: Really.\nLORELAI: Yeah, I finally got the girl band together and after a week opening stateside, we headed across the Atlantic and now we're huge with the Nordic set.\nCHRISTOPHER: It's good to hear from you. We haven't talked in awhile.\nLORELAI: You could've called too, you know. Or do you have one of those special phones that only receives calls?\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, I figured you had a lot going on what with the engagement and the canceling of the engagement. How's that going, by the way?\nLORELAI: No, still canceled.\nCHRISTOPHER: You okay?\nLORELAI: Good. And I'm even better when I'm not talking about it.\nCHRISTOPHER: Moving on then.\nLORELAI: So I have some shocking news. Rory's coming out.\nCHRISTOPHER: Out of what?\nLORELAI: Coming out. White dresses, gloves, curtsies.\nCHRISTOPHER: Stop it.\nLORELAI: I swear to God.\nCHRISTOPHER: I can't believe you're letting her do it.\nLORELAI: Oh, well, I wasn't about to let her use my method of getting out of it.\nCHRISTOPHER: This is crazy.\nLORELAI: She's doing it as a favor to my mom, there's no talking her out of it.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, did you tell her about Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke, Gloria Vanderbilt?\nLORELAI: Yes, and she's perfectly willing to marry Cary Grant, get offed by her crazy butler and start designing blue jeans as soon as the ball ends.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, okay, if that's what she wants.\nLORELAI: Now comes the reason for my phone call.\nCHRISTOPHER: All your regular 976 numbers are busy.\nLORELAI: Now I know this is totally not your thing, but as you will remember, part of the whole coming out process involves the girls being escorted around the dance floor by their Dads.\nCHRISTOPHER: Ah.\nLORELAI: Now, I know you would rather sit through \"Endless Love\" than ever be apart of this scene again. But this is very important to your daughter and she has never asked you for anything, and although no one's keeping track, it would seem that your constant non-presence in her life and your lack of ever showing up when you say you're going to or calling when you say you're going to or basically doing anything when you say you're going to would tend to indicate that you owe her, big time. Now before you say no, I want you to take a minute and remember you have a great daughter who needs you and she has a mother who will hunt you down like a half-priced Kate Spade purse if you disappoint her.\nCHRISTOPHER: Okay, I'm there.\nLORELAI: By there, do you mean the Daughters of the American Revolution Annual Debutante Ball?\nCHRISTOPHER: Yes.\nLORELAI: Oh Chris, please don't make this promise if you can't.\nCHRISTOPHER: I wouldn't miss it.\nLORELAI: It's next weekend.\nCHRISTOPHER: I'll clear my schedule.\nLORELAI: You swear?\nCHRISTOPHER: Oh wait, next weekend?\nLORELAI: Christopher!\nCHRISTOPHER: I'm kidding, I will definitely be there.\nLORELAI: Okay, and in exchange for that I will refrain from saying the ten things that came to mind for making fun of your schedule.\nCHRISTOPHER: Thanks.\nLORELAI: Bye.\nCHRISTOPHER: Bye.\n[Rory walks into living room]\nLORELAI: Hey Little Debbie, your dad is definitely gonna be there.\nRORY: You're kidding!\nLORELAI: No, he's gonna walk you down the stairs, and turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy, and announce that Rory Gilmore is officially open for business.\nRORY: I can't believe it. And he definitely said definitely?\nLORELAI: Definitely.\nRORY: So there's a fifty/fifty chance.\nLORELAI: I don't know. He sounded pretty sure, I'd say sixty/forty.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Dean, Lane and Rory are on the couch watching TV while Lorelai walks around the living room talking on the telephone.]\nLORELAI: No Mom, I'm sure one crinolin will be plenty. No, she doesn't. I'm sure she doesn't. Yeah, in what scenario would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves, Mom? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant what scenario on my planet would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves?\nRORY: So?\nDEAN: So what?\nRORY: It's good huh?\nDEAN: It's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.\nRORY: And doesn't Neil Young look cool?\nDEAN: I guess.\nRORY: If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux.\nDEAN: Neil Young looks cool because he's Neil Young, not because he's wearing a tux.\nLORELAI: No, I don't have to ask her mom 'cause I know the answer. I know the answer Mom, I know the answer. Yeah, no, okay, well I don't have to ask her MomHold on. Rory, would you like Grandma's hairstylist to come and set your hair before the ball? . . Oh, I did not coach her Mom, go back to talking about gloves.\nRORY: I think you're gonna look great in a tux.\nLANE: Tails.\nDEAN: What?\nLANE: Yeah, according to this it says that all escorts must be properly attired in black tails, white cumberbuns, and white gloves.\nDEAN: What?\nRORY: I'm sure the gloves are optional.\nLANE: Not according to this.\nDEAN: Tails? Gloves?\nRORY: Remember Neil Young. Remember that you love me. Remember that I'll be watching BattleBots with you for a month.\nDEAN: Show me Neil Young again.\n[Horn honks from outside]\nRORY: Dad!\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Christopher is getting out of his car as Rory and Lorelai walk out the front door.]\nRORY: Dad! [runs to the car]\nCHRISTOPHER: Whoa! Hold it right there. A lady never runs out to meet a gentleman caller who hasn't been announced.\nRORY: Sorry, we haven't tamed my wild ways yet.\nCHRISTOPHER: Thank God I'm here now.\nRORY: I missed you! [hugs him]\nCHRISTOPHER: Me too.\nLORELAI: Hey.\nCHRISTOPHER: Hey.\nLORELAI: What is this?\nCHRISTOPHER: What? Oh my God, where did this come from?\nLORELAI: What happened to your bike?\nCHRISTOPHER: A crazy game of key exchange at the car wash.\nLORELAI: This is a car.\nCHRISTOPHER: Yes it is.\nLORELAI: It has four wheels and a roof and airbags and seat belts and my God, it smells like a forest.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, I needed a little more space. Had something big to haul. I believe this belongs to you. [hands Rory a box from the trunk]\nRORY: The Compact Oxford English Dictionary!\nCHRISTOPHER: I promised you I'd get it. I'm just sorry it took so long.\nRORY: That's okay.\nCHRISTOPHER: On the bright side, this is the new edition. If I'd gotten you the old one, you wouldn't have the word 'jiggy' in it.\nRORY: Thank you. I love it, I'm gonna go look things up right now.\nCHRISTOPHER: Wait wait. [hands her magnifying glass]\nRORY: Thanks.\nCHRISTOPHER: Go. [Rory goes inside]\nLORELAI: That was really great of you.\nCHRISTOPHER: Thank you. So back to mocking my car?\nLORELAI: Oh yeah. A Volvo sedan, are you kidding?\nCHRISTOPHER: This is a great car.\nLORELAI: For driving to bingo.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, it just seemed like time. I couldn't keep showing up for work on my bike.\nLORELAI: Work?\nCHRISTOPHER: You've heard of it.\nLORELAI: Yes, but I didn't think you had.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, it took awhile. I kept getting it mixed up with nap, but I finally figured it out.\nLORELAI: So, you bought a car and got a job?\nCHRISTOPHER: Actually, job then car.\nLORELAI: Oh, 'cause it's more responsible that way.\nCHRISTOPHER: Exactly.\nLORELAI: Wow, so tell me about the job.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, I show up everyday, drink bad coffee, exchange lame pleasantries in the break room with Linda from marketing, and then at the end of two weeks they give me a paycheck. It's a pretty cool system.\nLORELAI: You're serious?\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, you know how us working types are. Get in.\nLORELAI: Well uh. . .I'm not supposed to take rides with strangers.\nCHRISTOPHER: Trust me.\nLORELAI: Yes, but only if you promise we won't go over 25 miles an hour on the motorway. [Lorelai gets in as Christopher blasts some music] Oh my God, George Lucas wishes he had this sound system.\nCHRISTOPHER: I've got Alpine head units, two subs, and two twelves. In exchange, no passenger-side airbag.\nLORELAI: Ah, so the old Christopher still lives.\n[Rory leans in the car window.]\nRORY: Could you please attenuate the cacophony out here?\nLORELAI: Huh?\n[Rory reaches in and adjusts the volume]\nRORY: Turn down the music. [goes back inside]\nLORELAI: Next time instead of a dictionary, just slip her a crisp twenty.\nCHRISTOPHER: Deal.\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Lorelai and Emily walk through the front door carrying several shopping bags.]\nLORELAI: Twelve pairs of pantyhose.\nEMILY: It's going to be a long night. She's bound to have a run.\nLORELAI: Twelve pairs.\nEMILY: There's the presentation, the circle, the curtsy, the fan dance.\nLORELAI: Mom, there'd have to be a 12k run and a jujitsu demonstration for her to go through twelve pairs of pantyhose.\nEMILY: Does it really hurt to be prepared, Lorelai?\nLORELAI: No, Mom, it doesn't hurt to be prepared.\nEMILY: Thank you.\nLORELAI: And the good news is, now she is prepared for her high school graduation, her college graduation, her marriage, three to five anniversaries, a hostess gig, and jury duty, especially if she's sequestered.\nEMILY: You make me tired.\n[Richard walks down the stairs.]\nEMILY: Oh Richard, I didn't know you were home.\nRICHARD: Yes, well, we learn something everyday.\nEMILY: You didn't have to work?\nRICHARD: I am working.\nLORELAI: Hey Dad, guess how many pairs of pantyhose we bought today?\nRICHARD: I'd rather not, if you don't mind.\nEMILY: Oh Richard, I got you some beautiful new cufflinks for this weekend.\nRICHARD: I already have cufflinks.\nEMILY: I know, but these have bulldogs on them. Come look.\nRICHARD: I'll look at them later.\nEMILY: All right, fine. Just remember to pick up your tux from the cleaners tomorrow.\nRICHARD: I won't have time.\nEMILY: It's right around the corner from your office.\nRICHARD: I have to go in early tomorrow.\nEMILY: Well, go now.\nRICHARD: I am busy now.\nEMILY: Doing what?\nRICHARD: Emily, I am not going to qualify my time with you. I am not going to pick up my tuxedo. You planned this ridiculous affair, you pick up my tuxedo. Or I simply don't have to go. Either one of these options is fine with me. [leaves]\nLORELAI: Hey Mom, I might be reading too much into this, but um, is something going on between you and Dad?\nEMILY: What are you talking about?\nLORELAI: I don't know, he just seems a little less jolly than usual.\nEMILY: He's just busy.\nLORELAI: He seems upset.\nEMILY: Well, he's not.\nLORELAI: You seem upset.\nEMILY: Well I'm not. We're both fine.\nLORELAI: Okay, my mistake.\nEMILY: I better go pick up his tux.\nCUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO\n[Rory and Dean are practicing dancing.]\nMISS PATTY: Now, keep counting in your heads. Look each other in the eye. Dean, are you leading?\nDEAN: I have no idea.\nMISS PATTY: Okay okay, stop stop stop. Now remember, one of the most important things in ballroom dancing is to remember to spot, otherwise you're gonna get dizzy. So, what you wanna do is you wanna pick out something to focus on. I usually like to find a lonely seaman. Then when turning, whip your head around and find your spot again. [spins around] Hello sailor, hello sailor, hello sailor. Now you try it.\nDEAN: You've gotta be kidding me.\nRORY: I think you can do it without the 'hello sailor' part.\nDEAN: Rory.\nRORY: BattleBots.\nDEAN: For the rest of your life.\nMISS PATTY: Now take it from the top.\n[Rory and Dean start dancing again as Lorelai and Christopher walk in with coffee.]\nLORELAI: Hey, you guys are really improving. Now you're actually facing each other.\nCHRISTOPHER: Anyone need a break?\nMISS PATTY: Okay, take five, but don't sit down because your muscles will get cold.\nLORELAI: So how's it going?\nRORY: Actually, I'm not very good.\nDEAN: Yeah, which is really holding me back because I'm a natural.\nLORELAI: Well, maybe you just need a glittery glove and a really freaky face.\nRORY: At one point Miss Patty thought Dean was gonna get hurt, she made me sit in the corner and watch.\nLORELAI: Hey! Nobody puts Baby in the corner.\nCHRISTOPHER: It's not your fault. Ballroom dancing is a wonderfully sexist thing. Any woman can do it, all she needs is a strong male lead. No offense Dean. [He pulls Lorelai towards him, but she stumbles.]\nLORELAI: Oh, agh!\nCHRISTOPHER: Oh, well, most any woman can do it.\nLORELAI: I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready. I want a do over.\nCHRISTOPHER: Fine. May I have this dance?\nLORELAI: I don't know. Do you have a trust fund? Always make sure.\n[Lorelai and Christopher start dancing. When they're done, Rory and Dean clap.]\nRORY: Okay, I'm adopted.\nDEAN: Yeah, I'm never gonna be able to do that.\nCHRISTOPHER: No, you guys just need some practice.\nMISS PATTY: Listen to your father, Rory. Your adorable, adorable father.\nLORELAI: Come on, let's get you out of here before you become Patty's next husband.\nCHRISTOPHER: See you guys later. Bye Patty.\nMISS PATTY: Oh, the way you toy with me.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai and Christopher walk out of the dance studio each holding a coffee cup.]\nLORELAI: Did you know you still knew how to do that?\nCHRISTOPHER: I wish I didn't. Imagine what we could do if we freed up the brain space that holds onto the Vianese Waltz.\nLORELAI: Yeah, it's right up there in between old Brady Bunch reruns and the lyrics to Rapture.\nCHRISTOPHER: Ooh, I gotta say, this isn't like the chai lattes in Boston.\nLORELAI: Yeah, well, expecting Luke to make a chai anything was completely insane.\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he just threw a cinnamon stick in some tea.\nLORELAI: I'm pretty sure it's not a cinnamon stick.\nCHRISTOPHER: Okay, throwing this out now.\nLORELAI: So chai latte, when did that happen?\nCHRISTOPHER: I don't know. Everyone at work drinks them.\nLORELAI: Huh. Well, since you still haven't told me what exactly it is that you do, I'm gonna go with yoga instructor or chiropractor.\nCHRISTOPHER: No, it's actually pretty interesting. I'm working for this firm that helps those overblown tech companies scale back and stay afloat now that they're facing leaner times.\nLORELAI: I'm sorry, uh, what's the interesting part?\nCHRISTOPHER: We dress like superheroes when we do it.\nLORELAI: Oh, nice. So how long do you think you'll be able to keep this going?\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm pretty happy there. I'd say at least 'til Tuesday.\nLORELAI: Oh, so long term.\nCHRISTOPHER: You know, it's weird. I always hated the idea of having to be somewhere at a specific time day after day, but as it turns out, I like the stability.\nLORELAI: Really?\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah. I like that at the end of the day, I feel like I've done something. I've earned something.\nLORELAI: Well, I think that's really great.\nCHRISTOPHER: Only took me ten years and several failed business ventures to figure out what I wanted.\nLORELAI: Which is?\nCHRISTOPHER: Not my parents' life.\nLORELAI: Ah.\nCHRISTOPHER: Something you figured out at sixteen.\nLORELAI: Actually, six months, but I just couldn't vocalize it yet.\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah, you knew what you wanted, you went out and got it. I was always a little jealous of you.\nLORELAI: Well, you seem to be catching up. We did good.\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Well, I did good. The fact that she can't follow a lead is all you.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Rory sits on the couch painting her toenails, Christopher helps Dean tie his bowtie, Lorelai walks around with a book on her head eating Chinese food.]\nLORELAI: See now, only a lady can gracefully walk around a room with a book on her head while eating Kung Pao chicken. And a great lady can even spit the peanuts back into the container without anyone noticing.\nRORY: Wow.\nLORELAI: Yeah, well, don't be intimidated. You have to practice and practice to get to my level.\nRORY: Anyone want the last eggroll?\nDEAN: Uh, no.\nLORELAI: Heh. Where are you going?\nRORY: To get the eggroll.\nLORELAI: You're getting the eggroll yourself?\nRORY: Yes.\nLORELAI: No! Ladies never get their own eggrolls. Ladies never get their own anything. They don't even get their own ideas.\nRORY: Oh boy.\nLORELAI: They just sit helplessly and wait for some young strong man to come by and assist them. They don't step in puddles, they don't step over puddles. They can't even look at puddles. They actually need to be blindfolded and thrown in a sack and carried over puddles.\nRORY: Isn't there a moratorium on how long ladies are supposed to talk?\nLORELAI: Uhh, no. Now repeat after me, I am completely helpless.\nCHRISTOPHER: Okay, so you pull the left side through the back loop and tug a little bit on both sides, and you my friend, might just be mistaken for a gentleman. Or a waiter.\nDEAN: So, how do you know how to do this?\nCHRISTOPHER: Seventeen cotillions, a dozen debutante balls, and a brief but scarring experiment with the Children of the American Revolution.\nLORELAI: Where you wore nothing but the bowtie.\nCHRISTOPHER: A good idea on conception, but the sudden snowstorm instantly dampened the effect.\nDEAN: Hey, uh, do you think it's cool when Neil Young wears a tux?\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah, of course, but it's Neil Young.\nDEAN: All right. I should get going. I'll see you at three.\nRORY: Okay. Oh wait. [hands him a box]\nDEAN: What's this?\nRORY: Your gloves.\nDEAN: I thought you were kidding.\nLORELAI: No no. Ladies never kid.\nDEAN: Bye. [leaves]\nLORELAI: Bye.\nRORY: I think I'm going to bed too.\nLORELAI: Do you need help?\nRORY: No.\nLORELAI: Wrong! The correct answer is yes. Ladies need help with everything.\nRORY: Goodnight.\nLORELAI: [sighs]\nCHRISTOPHER: Night.\nRORY: Night.\nLORELAI: I don't know about that girl. I don't know how she's ever gonna make it in society. At this rate, she's gonna actually get a job and only marry once.\nCHRISTOPHER: You calling your mom again?\nLORELAI: I don't get it. For the last week, every five minutes she's calling me checking on shoe fittings and curtsy progress, and have I talked Rory into putting her hair up yet, and then tonight, nothing.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm sure they had a lot of getting ready to do for themselves tonight.\nLORELAI: She's been acting so weird lately. They're fighting. Openly fighting. I don't think they've ever done that before. I'm not sure what to do about it.\nCHRISTOPHER: Move to California. That's what I do when my parents fight.\nLORELAI: You know, my father doesn't even want to go tomorrow. His perfect angle granddaughter is being presented to society in front of all his friends and colleagues, something he never got to do with his bad, loser, evil daughter.\nCHRISTOPHER: Maybe you should talk to them. I'm sorry, was that me that said that? I must've had an aneurysm.\nLORELAI: Well, nothing more I can do tonight. I'm gonna head up to bed. Do you want me to turn off the lights?\nCHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to stay up and do a little work tonight.\n[Lorelai laughs]\nLORELAI: I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that's not a joke anymore.\nCHRISTOPHER: Goodnight.\nCUT TO BALLROOM\n[Lorelai and Rory arrive at the ballroom.]\nRORY: Wow, this place is huge. Do I have to walk down those stairs?\nLORELAI: Oh, I'm afraid so. Unless you wanna make a really memorable entrance and just sliiide down the banister. Which I totally encourage, by the way.\nLADY: You are\nRORY: Lorelai Gilmore.\nLADY: Late.\nLORELAI: Sorry, my fault. Took me awhile to get pretty. Not all of us are sixteen anymore, you know what I mean? No.\nLADY: You are to head up the stairs. The preparation room is on the right.\nLORELAI: Look for the toxic cloud of Chanel and Final Net.\n[Rory starts walking towards the stairs. She looks back at Lorelai.]\nLORELAI: [mouths] Sliiide.\nCUT TO PREPARATION ROOM\n[Rory and the lady enter the room. Other girls are walking around getting dressed and doing their makeup.]\nLADY: Hang your dress there, put your makeup on over there. You'll have to make do with a non-lighted mirror. The lighted ones went to the girls that were here before dawn. Listen up ladies, everyone must be beautiful and ready to go by 7:30.\n[Rory sits down at a mirror. She talks to the girl next to her.]\nRORY: I can't believe we have an hour and a half.\nLIBBY: I know, I am never gonna be ready in time. God only knows if the swelling on my nose is gonna go down. I had to go and inherit my father's nose. I'm Libby.\nRORY: Rory.\nLIBBY: Uh, which one should I wear? I've thought about this all month, and I cannot decide.\nRORY: Oh, well, that's a tough one.\nLIBBY: I know. This is red red, and this is orange red. The wrong one and I will end up looking like a hooker. Or a teacher.\nRORY: That's a lot of pressure.\nLIBBY: The two minutes you are standing on those stairs tonight will determine the social status for the rest of your life.\nRORY: Wow, what if you trip? I mean, not that you would. You wouldn't. I might. Probably will actually. Could be a real Cirque du Soleil kind of night.\nLIBBY: You should not even joke about stuff like that. Ow. There's a head under there, you know.\nCUT TO BALLROOM\n[The bartender hands Lorelai a drink.]\nLORELAI: You are a wonderful, wonderful man. I have a feeling we're going to be very close tonight. [sees Emily] Hmm. Mom, you're here.\nEMILY: Where should I be, Spain?\nLORELAI: Oh. I tried calling you all night last night.\nEMILY: I was very busy.\nLORELAI: And then we got here before you.\nEMILY: What is your point, Lorelai?\nLORELAI: Nothing. It's just weird.\nEMILY: Well, I'm here now, so it's not weird anymore. Look at these flowers. Baby's breath. What is this, County General?\nLORELAI: You look very nice Mom. I like your dress.\nEMILY: Cotton tablecloths, folding chairs. It's not supposed to be like this. In my day, people sat in real chairs.\nLORELAI: Mom, what's the matter?\nEMILY: I wanted my granddaughter to be presented to society in a beautiful elegant ballroom, not a Shakey's.\nLORELAI: The room is beautiful Mom. You're being too critical.\nEMILY: There's Nan. I'm going to have a little talk with her about the proper height for a taper.\nLORELAI: Mom.\nCUT TO PREPARATION ROOM\n[Rory is sitting down reading when Libby walks over to her holding a flask.]\nLIBBY: Midori sour?\nRORY: Oh, no thanks.\nLIBBY: More for me. At my last coming out, I shared with this girl who couldn't handle her booze. Neon green puke all over her white dress.\nRORY: Your last coming out?\nLIBBY: Oh, this is my fifth one this year.\nRORY: Wow.\nLIBBY: You know, they say four out of five debs marry their escorts.\nRORY: Kind of like the dentists with Trident.\nLIBBY: Well I figure, five coming out balls, five escorts, one of them has to stick, right?\nRORY: Good logic.\nLIBBY: So, is your escort the one?\nRORY: The one what?\nLIBBY: The one you're gonna marry.\nRORY: Oh, well\nLIBBY: Is he cute?\nRORY: Yes, he is very cute but\nLIBBY: Where are you guys planning to live when you get married?\nRORY: Okay, hold on a second.\n[Another girl walks over]\nLIBBY: Katie, hi. Too bad about your face.\nKATIE: Is it horrible?\nLIBBY: No, you can hardly tell. Just walk sideways.\nCUT TO BALLROOM\n[Lorelai is standing with some women.]\nLADY 1: These things will be the death of me.\nLADY 2: Oh I know. And we've had no time to prep. Janet just got out of Rainbow Hills two days ago.\nLORELAI: Rehab?\nLADY 1: Fat farm.\nLORELAI: Ah.\n[Christopher walks up to Lorelai]\nCHRISTOPHER: Hi, sorry to interrupt. Could you come with me? My cumberbun and I aren't seeing eye to eye.\nLORELAI: Men, totally helpless. Excuse me.\n[They walk away from the women]\nLORELAI: You saved me. I love you. I wanna have your baby. Oops, too late.\nCHRISTOPHER: I saw the look. Same one you had that time you ended up on homecoming court.\nLORELAI: Ugh, someone's idea of a sick, sick joke. Hey, by the way, Neil Young's got nothing on you.\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah?\nLORELAI: Yeah.\n[Emily walks over to them]\nEMILY: Lorelai, have you seen your father?\nLORELAI: Uh, no.\nEMILY: He promised me he'd be here by now.\nLORELAI: Wait, you didn't come together?\nEMILY: I swear, if he misses this\nLORELAI: Well, Mom, did you call him?\nEMILY: Yes I called him. Of course I called him. I wouldn't go this long without calling him.\nCHRISTOPHER: Emily, he's here.\nEMILY: Where? [he points to him] Oh. [walks to Richard] Richard, where have you been?\nRICHARD: Where have I been?\nEMILY: Yes, where have you been?\nRICHARD: I'm here, aren't I?\nLORELAI: I can't look. Did she beat him with the baby's breath?\nCHRISTOPHER: No, they're just energetically practicing their sign language.\nLORELAI: Oh God.\nCHRISTOPHER: Okay, I think this is a really good time for a martini. Hello. Thirsty people here. [Lorelai goes behind the bar] Ah, what are you doing?\nLORELAI: Steve won't mind.\nCHRISTOPHER: Little tip. Never a good idea to let people know you're on a first name basis with the bartender. Wow, this is really something.\nLORELAI: What?\nCHRISTOPHER: You and I together at a debutante ball.\nLORELAI: Huh, yeah.\nCHRISTOPHER: Just like it would've been sixteen years ago.\nLORELAI: Fancy dress.\nCHRISTOPHER: Sneaking booze.\nLORELAI: Parents acting crazy.\nCHRISTOPHER: You look great.\nLORELAI: I'm so glad you're here.\nCHRISTOPHER: So am I.\nANNOUNCER: All fathers please report to the debutante staging area upstairs. Fathers to the staging area.\nCHRISTOPHER: Showtime. You gonna be all right?\nLORELAI: Absolutely.\nCHRISTOPHER: I'll see you later.\nLORELAI: Curtsy pretty.\nCUT TO STAGING AREA\n[Rory's waiting in line. Dean walks up to her.]\nDEAN: Hey. I just wanted to see you before you became a proper lady of society.\nRORY: So what do you think?\nDEAN: I think you look like a cotton ball.\nRORY: Why, thank you Jeeves.\nDEAN: But a really cute cotton ball.\n[Libby walks up to Rory.]\nLIBBY: Oh my God, is this your escort?\nRORY: Yeah, it is.\nLIBBY: You are totally getting married. [walks away]\nDEAN: What did she say?\nRORY: Oh, well...[sees Christopher] Dad, great, let's go.\nDEAN: I'll, uh, I'll meet you downstairs. Good luck. [leaves]\nRORY: Okay.\nCHRISTOPHER: Last chance to shimmy down the drainpipe.\nRORY: Do me a favor?\nCHRISTOPHER: Anything.\nRORY: Just don't let me fall.\nCHRISTOPHER: Right back at ya.\nCUT TO BALLROOM [The ball begins as a lady addresses the audience from a podium on the staircase. Lorelai sits at a table; Emily and Richard stand near the bar.]\nLADY AT PODIUM: Good evening. On behalf of the Daughters of the American Revolution, I would like to welcome you to our annual debutante ball. Oh this brings back so many memories. I myself came out in this very hall in nineteenwell, let's just say, a number of years ago. Now the word debutante comes from the French word debuter, which means to lead off. . .[fades into background]\nEMILY: Just come sit down.\nRICHARD: I am going to finish my drink.\nEMILY: You won't be happy until you've spoiled this entire evening, will you?\nLORELAI: Um, guys, hi, there's a lady up there with a rock the size of Neptune around her neck talking about the debutantes of ancient Greece. It's a lot easier to fall asleep if you're sitting down, trust me.\nRICHARD: I will sit down when I'm ready to sit down.\nEMILY: Richard, lower your voice.\nRICHARD: No, I will not lower my voice. I paid a fortune to be here, and I will speak just as loudly as I like.\nEMILY: You're embarrassing us. You're embarrassing Rory.\nRICHARD: Embarrassing Rory? This wasn't Rory's idea. This was your idea. This whole ridiculous evening was your idea, Emily.\nEMILY: You don't want your granddaughter presented to society?\nRICHARD: To hell with society. [people look at him] Yes, I'm talking about you!\nLORELAI: Come on, that's it.\n[Lorelai leads them into another room]\nLORELAI: Are you two completely out of your mind? There is a ceremony going on in there. Young girls in ugly dresses and stupid fans are parading around in circles for God knows what reason, and you two are ruining it.\nRICHARD: I didn't want to come here. You knew I didn't want to come here.\nEMILY: Well, that's too bad. We have a social responsibility Richard.\nRICHARD: I am so tired of hearing you say that.\nEMILY: People expect us to be certain places and do certain things and we can't just withdraw from all of that.\nRICHARD: Do you know what I'm going through at work?\nEMILY: Your whole life isn't that damn company, Richard.\nRICHARD: I have told you what I'm going through, but somehow, you just don't seem to hear it. You don't listen to me. You don't listen to anybody.\nEMILY: That is not true.\nRICHARD: It is true. Isn't it true? Has she ever listened to a word you've said?\nLORELAI: Oh, well, hey, people listen in different ways, right? I mean, some people listen with their ears, and some people listen with not their ears, but that doesn't mean some actual listening hasn't happened in some form.\nEMILY: I have listened to you Richard. I know exactly what is going on with you.\nRICHARD: Really, what?\nEMILY: You lost an account.\nLORELAI: What?\nRICHARD: No, I didn't lose an account. I was taken off an account. I was taken off an account that I personally brought into this company ten years ago.\nEMILY: There are other accounts, Richard.\nRICHARD: I have been in charge of that account for ten years!\nEMILY: How can you be so angry? Yes, they took you off that account, but they also gave you a promotion.\nRICHARD: Oh, Emily.\nEMILY: You said they moved you upstairs to a larger office and gave you a new title and a better parking space.\nRICHARD: Emily, dammit, I am being phased out.\nEMILY: You are not.\nRICHARD: What do you mean I'm not? I know whether I'm being phased out. I invented phased out for this company. Don't you think I did the exact same thing to Alan Parker?\nEMILY: Alan Parker retired.\nRICHARD: Alan Parker was phased out. I now have his office, I now have his parking space. Do you know what happens from here? I lose more accounts, slowly but surely. They will put a younger man on them with me to be trained by the best. And then, one day they'll call and ask me to let that young man take a meeting without me, just to see how fast he's learning, and then suddenly that young man is given that account. And this happens again and again and again until I'm nothing, but a symbolic figurehead that they roll out for banquets and group pictures. And then one day, Emily, I will be asked to leave.\nEMILY: Well, so what?\nRICHARD: Excuse me.\nLORELAI: Dad, I don't think Mom meant exactly\nEMILY: So what if that's true?\nLORELAI: Or maybe she did.\nEMILY: There are other options.\nRICHARD: I don't want other options. I want to get up every morning and put on my suit, and go to my office, and do my work, like I've done everyday for the past thirty years. That's what I want to do. That's the only thing I want to do.\n[Rory leans into the hallway.]\nRORY: Um, excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt, but I'm next.\n[They walk back into the ballroom]\nLADY AT PODIUM: Elizabeth Dotie, daughter of George Edward Dotie the fourth, and Elenor Dotie. [pause] Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Christopher Hayden and Lorelai Gilmore.\n[Christopher and Rory walk down the stairs as Dean waits at the bottom. Christopher kisses Rory's hand, Rory curtsies, Christopher walks away, Dean walks Rory down the aisle.]\nEMILY: That should've been you up there. Nothing's turning out the way it was supposed to. [walks away]\nCUT TO STARS HOLLOW\n[Later that night, Lorelai, Christopher, Rory, and Dean walk down the sidewalk.]\nRORY: So did you know that you're considered a hot Dad?\nLORELAI: Hah!\nCHRISTOPHER: Really?\nRORY: Libby said that it's too bad you're my real Dad because if you were my stepdad, I could steal you away from mom.\nLORELAI: Ugh.\nCHRISTOPHER: That Libby's got a good life ahead of her.\nLORELAI: Well, I was very proud of all of you. You made it through the entire ceremony with a completely straight face. Almost all of you.\nCHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry, but that fan dance was more than I could take.\nLORELAI: Hey, I need a burger.\nRORY: Me too. Dean?\nDEAN: Honestly, the only thing I can think of is taking off this tux.\nLORELAI: Hey, watch it, you're talking to a lady now.\nDEAN: Well, how about if I do it at home?\nLORELAI: Better.\nRORY: Thanks again for going with me.\nDEAN: Tomorrow you start paying. Bye. [leaves]\nLORELAI: Bye. And then there were three.\nCHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to get back to Boston first thing in the morning so I'm gonna call it a night too.\nRORY: What? Not even time for fries?\nCHRISTOPHER: I'll tell you what. I'll get up a little early and have coffee with you before I go. Deal?\nRORY: Deal.\nLORELAI: Honey, go ahead and order for us. I'll be there in a sec.\nRORY: Okay. [leaves]\nLORELAI: I just wanted to tell you how amazing you were tonight. Really, you completely came through for her.\nCHRISTOPHER: She deserves it.\nLORELAI: I haven't always given you a lot of credit in the past, but I'm giving you credit now. Big credit. Major credit. Buy yourself a sofa.\nCHRISTOPHER: Thanks. I will.\nLORELAI: You know, um, I happened to be looking through some old maps this afternoon and I couldn't help but notice that Boston is not that far away.\nCHRISTOPHER: Aw, you needed a map to tell you that?\nLORELAI: I also noticed that that, um, I-84 is a very good road. Solid, paved.\nCHRISTOPHER: Uh huh.\nLORELAI: And I put this information in my pretty little head, I was thinking, if you wanted to maybe drop by occasionally, it wouldn't be too difficult.\nCHRISTOPHER: You realize I'll be driving the Volvo?\nLORELAI: Actually, I'm coming around to the Vovlo.\nCHRISTOPHER: Really?\nLORELAI: Yes. I think it's sort of a Catholic schoolgirl thing, you know? It's conservative on the outside, bad on the inside.\nCHRISTOPHER: I like that image.\nLORELAI: I've also heard the I-84 can get jammed on the weekends.\nCHRISTOPHER: It can.\nLORELAI: So if you wanted to stay a little longer, just to avoid the traffic, it might be a good idea. I mean, Rory would definitely love it, and I wouldn't mind either. CHRISTOPHER: That is a tempting offer, but I really have to get back.\nLORELAI: To work?\nCHRISTOPHER: To workand to someone.\nLORELAI: Oh.\nCHRISTOPHER: I know I should've told you.\nLORELAI: Oh no, that's fine. That's totally your business.\nCHRISTOPHER: No, I meant to, butLor, it's just that you and I are so connected and...\nLORELAI: Chris, please, I get it. I think it's really great, I really do.\nCHRISTOPHER: Thank you.\nLORELAI: So who is it? Ooh, let me guess. Linda from marketing got to you, didn't she?\nCHRISTOPHER: Her name is Sherri.\nLORELAI: Sherri from marketing?\nCHRISTOPHER: Sherri from Boston.\nLORELAI: Ah, hence the move.\nCHRISTOPHER: Yes.\nLORELAI: Is it serious?\nCHRISTOPHER: It's getting there.\nLORELAI: Seeing you in just a bowtie serious?\nCHRISTOPHER: We're living together.\nLORELAI: Wow, you really have changed.\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well, Sherri made it pretty clear that I was gonna lose her if I didn't start getting it together, so...\nLORELAI: Yeah, well if you find a girl who's good with dating a square in a Volvo, you do what it takes to keep her.\nCHRISTOPHER: Okay, uh, so I'll. . .I'll see you back home.\nLORELAI: Yes you will.\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Rory is about to bite into her burger as Lorelai walks in.]\nLORELAI: [gasps] Hey!\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: After all you've been through tonight and I come in here and find you eating like that.\n[Rory raises her pinkie]\nLORELAI: There you go.\nRORY: Being a lady is hard.\nLORELAI: So tonight, what's the consensus?\nRORY: The fan dance was humiliating, I'm never doing a curtsy again, but having Dad around was great.\nLORELAI: Yeah, it was.\nRORY: He's got a new girlfriend, you know.\nLORELAI: Sherri.\nRORY: Yeah.\nLORELAI: Poor girl's named after a Journey song, that's gotta be rough.\nRORY: He seems happy.\nLORELAI: He does. He really does.\nRORY: I'm glad.\nLORELAI: Me too.\nRORY: I feel kind of bad for Grandma though. She was so into this night and then she ended up being so miserable.\nLORELAI: Don't worry. She'll have more fun at the next one.\nRORY: Excuse me?\nLORELAI: Yes, we have you signed up for the next six balls.\nRORY: Not funny.\nLORELAI: Hey, you're doing this until you bring home a prize.\nRORY: Ignoring you now.\n[Luke brings Lorelai her burger.]\nLUKE: So, back from the ball huh?\nLORELAI: Yes, I left behind a glass slipper and a business card in case the prince is really dumb.\nLUKE: Good and desperate thinking.\nLORELAI: Thank you. Hmm, Luke.\nLUKE: What?\n[Lorelai nods towards Jess, who is wiping down the counter dressed like Luke, complete with flannel shirt and backwards baseball cap. Luke walks over to him.]\nLUKE: What do you think you're doing?\nJESS: Working.\nLUKE: So you think this is funny, huh?\nJESS: I'm sorry. I thought this was the uniform.\nLUKE: Okay, you know what, that's fine. Have your little joke, you know. It doesn't bother me at all. You just go over there and clean off that table, okay? I'm ignoring you. You do not exist.\nJESS: Okay.\nLUKE: That's it, get upstairs and change.\nJESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke.\nLUKE: It's Luke, just Luke. Mister Luke. In fact, don't address me at all.\nLORELAI: You know, I'm really lucky.\nRORY: Yeah, why?\nLORELAI: I have someone to complain to when life sucks or work sucks or just everything sucks. I have someone I can talk to.\nRORY: Yeah, who?\nLORELAI: Oh Shecky, you k*ll me. It just must be really lonely not to have that.\nRORY: Are you thinking about Grandma?\nLORELAI: I'm just. . .thinking.\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Emily is gardening on the back patio as Lorelai walks out the back door.]\nLORELAI: Hey Mom.\nEMILY: What are you doing here?\nLORELAI: Oh, nothing much. I had a little time before my business class and I thought, 'Hey, why don't I just go over to Mom's house and just hang.'\nEMILY: Just what?\nLORELAI: Just hang, you know. Hang out. Talk, don't talk, whatever. Just hang.\nEMILY: Oh.\nLORELAI: So you're gardening, huh?\nEMILY: Yes.\nLORELAI: Okay. Well, don't let me stop you. I'll just sit here and just hang.\nEMILY: Are you sure you don't need something?\nLORELAI: Nope. I'm just here to hang.\nEMILY: Hang. Well.\nLORELAI: You know Mom, if there's ever anything you want to talk about with me, you can.\nEMILY: All right.\nLORELAI: Okay.

It gives her a unique expression.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Like she had a stroke?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Fine, I'll just use the Mrs. Potato Head lips.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, forget it, leave stroke-mouth. It's not like we're gonna win this anyway.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Whoa, bad attitude.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom, face it. That is the single most incredible snowman I have ever seen. [looks at a man working on an elaborate snow sculpture]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm sorry, that snowman is way over the top, way too showy. It's screaming 'I'm incredible, I'm special, look at me.'<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Kind of the point of a snowman-building contest.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hmm, I hate this man with every fiber of my being.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He looks nice.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: He's a ringer.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: How do you figure?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Someone recruited him, promised him a handsome sum, financed his theatrical snowman accoutrements, so he could snatch victory away from a deserving local in order to bag the contest prize for himself.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Seems a little elaborate considering that the prize is a set of new US quarters.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, we're ignoring him now. So, what are we gonna do on your school break?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: A lot of nothing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sounds good.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Plus some homework.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And a lot of movies.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, we have to rent Godfather 3 on DVD.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You're kidding.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: In the audio commentary, Coppola actually defends casting Sofia.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Now that is fatherly love. What's all this homework you have to do?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Just stuff for the paper.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What? Why?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Because Paris wants the first issue back to be a double issue, so we have to prep over break and she says the news never sleeps.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What about Paris, does she ever sleep?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I think she periodically makes a whirring noise and then just shuts down.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, you can't work the whole time.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I won't, I promise. Oh my God.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He's power buffing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Aw, now that is just wrong.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: We're competing against the Michelangelo of snow.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And we're Ernest Builds a Snowman.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: We shouldn't look at him anymore.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Heads down, stay focused.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: We can do this.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Absolutely.<\/p>\n<p>[their snowman's head falls off]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Let's get some coffee?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Right behind you.<\/p>\n<p>OPENING CREDITS<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN<\/p>\n<p>[Michel is at the front desk on the phone.

That'sthat's no problem, sir. Yes. Yes, you can return it to Bradley International. That'sthat's very convenient. Or youyou canum, you - hold please. [puts phone down, walks over to Rune and grabs his arm]<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Ah!<\/p>\n<p>MICHEL: Stop that.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Stop what?<\/p>\n<p>MICHEL: Stop jumping like a Mexican bean.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Well, Lorelai asked me to dust the picture frames. How do you suggest that I clean the top, smartie? [Michel takes the picture off the wall] Well, I didn't know that you could do that.<\/p>\n<p>MICHEL: Yes, I am miraculously talented, aren't I?<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: I thought an alarm would go off like in The Thomas Crown Affair.<\/p>\n<p>MICHEL: That would be if this was a museum, and you were a man allowed in museums.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, no bickering in the lobby, guys.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Where are we allowed to bicker?<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: You've got all the mushrooms? You double checked?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: I've triple checked.

The makeniya?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Uh wait.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: What?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: I don't have makeniya.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: You don't have makeniya?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: I don't have makeniya.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: I made it up.

We are recreating an authentic 19th century meal.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: The servers are all gonna be in period clothing, they're gonna speak period English. Here, look at the costumes.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Nice.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: We're talking seven courses here. Soup, fish, Peacock Pie, the Baron of Beef, the salad, then the Plum Pudding and the Wassail.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And there's gonna be a big raised platform where the Squire of Bracebridge is going to preside over the festivities.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Yeah, he tastes the foods and makes pronouncements. He's like the host of the evening, and his costume is the coolest.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: It all sounds great.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Oh, it is, it is. By the way, you're playing Squire Bracebridge. Ready?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Let's go.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Yeah. [they leave]<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Huh? What was that?<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LOBBY<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: What are we looking at today?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, this is the last on our list. We've already got our trumpets, our madrigal singers<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Uh, sorry to interrupt but I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We've got all our servers lined up. This is just for recorder players and harpists. Hi. Uh, lay some on us guys.<\/p>\n<p>[two recorder players play]<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Hey, you cats really know how to blow those things.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You've got the gig. I will call you later with the details. Thanks.<\/p>\n<p>[the recorder players leave]<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: So are we clear on this? I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge. Sorry you were under the impression that I'd do this.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: When do the guests arrive?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thursday at four - on their own jet.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: After buying out the whole inn.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Must be nice to have money.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Uh! Hey, you know what struck me today?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Was it the fact that I'm not the Squire - did that strike you?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: We are crazy for doing this.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We're beyond crazy. We are 'Anne Heche speaking her secret language to God and looking for the spaceship in Fresno' crazy.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Oh Quiness, nokka don atta.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Il ek notra doska donne.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: And springing this on me at the last minute too, I mean, that's just manipulative.<\/p>\n<p>[a chef comes out of the kitchen]<\/p>\n<p>CHEF: Sookie, fire! [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: I gotta get back in the kitchen. You'll handle the harp?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You got it.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: All right, okay, I'll do it. I'll play Squire Bracebridge if that's what you want. Geez.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Thanks Sweetie. [walks to kitchen]<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: As long as it's not just because I fit the costume. It's because I fit the costume, isn't it? [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [to harpist] Go ahead.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai's cell phone rings while the harpist is playing]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [answers phone] Hi, it's Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lor, it's me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, hi Chris, how are you?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Good, good. You, uh, got a minute?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Uh oh.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: It's not an uh oh, I just wanted to run an idea by you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Run it.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Now it's totally your call and I don't want to step on any plans you've already made, but I know Rory has a break in school coming up, and I was wondering if you'd be cool with her coming to visit for a couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Uhh, a couple of days? You mean she'd stay the night?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, it's totally your call. Where are you, heaven?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Do you even have room for someone to stay?<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Not just room - a room. A designated guest room. Sherry fixed it up really nice.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Aww, good for her.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: So what do you think?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know. It's awfully last minute.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: It's totally last minute. You can say no and there'll be no hard feelings.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, it's really up to Rory to say yes or no.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: So you're cool with it?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, sure, if Rory is, yeah.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Great, that's great. Uh, thank you. I'll let you run it past her and you can get back to me whenever. No pressure.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No pressure.<\/p>\n<p>CHRISTOPHER: Talk to you later.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, talk to you later.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE<\/p>\n<p>[Emily, Richard, Lorelai and Rory are eating dinner silently. Rory get Lorelai's attention and gestures for her to say something.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So what are your travel plans Dad?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Hmm?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You and mom, you always go out of town this time of year.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Last year it was the Bahamas.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Yes, that's right, it was.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I remember you had fun too. You said the Bahamamians were real nice. The Bahamites? The Bahamamamamians?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: The Bahamians.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes. They were nice.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: They were nice.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So, what are your plans?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We're not going anywhere this year.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why not? Oh, well yeah, it can be really nice just to stay at home sometimes because you can do fun things that you normally wouldn't have time for.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, like play Running Charades, and get out that Slip 'n Slide.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: We'll see.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes, we'll see.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Would you all excuse me? I have to make some calls. Say goodbye before you leave, will you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, sure Dad.<\/p>\n<p>[Richard leaves]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: When is this awfulness with work gonna resolve itself?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I don't know. The man is so sensitive. He reads so much into every little perceived slight.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah. I remember one time when I was a kid, Dad had put on some weight, and he bought a new suit to try to cover it up. And he wore it for us and he said, 'How do I look?' and I said, 'You look fat.' [pause] But I guess that wasn't really a perceived slightso, I'll think of another example.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN LOBBY<\/p>\n<p>[Sookie is lecturing to a group of people; Kirk is transcribing everything she says on his laptop.]<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Keep in mind during the Bracebridge Dinner, we are not just servers, we are performers, so any time you're with a guest, you must be in character and you must speak Old English. It's a world we're creating here, so whatever we can doKirk, you're driving me crazy!<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: Who me? [reads transcript] 'Whatever we can do to Kirk you're driving me crazy.' Yeah, me. Ah, sorry.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Okay, now guys, look at the materials I gave you, and tell me if a guest asks you how the food's coming, what would be the appropriate Old English response? Rune!<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Greetings!<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: You just read the first thing on the list, didn't you?<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Maybe.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Guys, the correct response: Ah, oven's day with baked meat choke!<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Question?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Yeah?<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: What color dress will I be wearing when I say this?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Rune, don't be an idiot.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Well, this is stupid.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Shut up and pay attention to Sookie. She worked very hard to bring this about.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: Yes, but unfortunately we don't all share intimacies with her, so she doesn't cut us any slack.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: She doesn't treat me differently.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: She's called you Peaches three times. It's all in the transcript.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Sookie, instead of talking in Old English, can I just talk like an old man?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: What?<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Hey you kids, get off my lawn!<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: No, no you cannot just talk like an old man.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai walks into the lobby]<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Hi, honey, what's the matter?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: They're snowed in.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Who's snowed in?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: The Bracebridge group. They're stuck in Chicago. The dinner's off.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: No.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: I'm gonna cry.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I offered to fund the instant invention of a molecular transport device but they just didn't go for it.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Oh, that makes me so mad. And so sad. I'm smad!<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Sookie, does this mean that my pockets wileth not with money get choked? That sounded like Old English. Cool, huh?<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LUKE'S DINER<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai, Sookie, and Rory are sitting at a table]<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: I've got thirty pounds of aged beef, trays and trays of trout, mountains of pruned tarts. I diced pumpkins until my hands turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Take a sip<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: How can you stay so calm about this?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: There's nothing we can do about it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I can't believe they got snowed in.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: All that work, all that extra help we hired. Oh well. At least they paid for it already. We didn't lose any money.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Yeah I guess. You know, I could still make up the dinner for the three of us.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, but then it would be like the three of us, all alone in the dining room.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It would be like The Shining, except instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune.<\/p>\n<p>[Luke walks over to them]<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: You girls want anything besides coffee?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Hey, what about Luke?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What about him?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: He eats, and Jess eats. Doesn't Jess eat?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What's she doing?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I think she's inviting you for dinner.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Yeah, come on, join us. It'll be fun. You like Peacock Pie?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I'm a hundred percent sure I don't.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: There'll be normal food too.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And decorations.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: And music.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Come on, it'll be fun.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Well<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, you know what?

Whose baby is this?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's your second cousin's Stan's. Poor kid.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Ugh, he got Stan's everything.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's not even the ugliest baby in the bunch.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're kidding.

Huh.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: They've got a cute little puppy and everything.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, I must've put it in the stack and forgotten to tell you about it. Well, there it is.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Nice looking lady.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mm hmm. Like a young Tammy Faye Baker.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But prettier than that.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, I didn't mean not pretty. Hey, question about the room list.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Room 31 - why is it empty?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh yeah, I wanted to run an idea by you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Run it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I thought maybe a certain depressed man and his wife could stay there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Woody and Soon-Yi?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Grandma and Grandpa.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ugh, you've got to be kidding.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But this could help to cheer him up.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'll send him a Def Jam Comedy tape. That'll cheer him up.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It's a really good thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We'll donate money to charity, that's a good thing too.

[walks away]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hey.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: So here are the materials in the double issue. Some of the articles are gonna need complete rewrites.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Drag.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Madeline's 500 words on test anxiety spends 400 of them arguing that stretch corduroy is the best material for low-rise jeans.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, let's see. Corduroy is a fabric, and the fabric of society is weakened when students<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You can't get there.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, it doesn't look like it.

I crush her every time.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well I was just thinking, maybe you want to stay for dinner?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Here?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah. We have a ton of food, and it's like a whole big show and everything, and if you're not doing anything<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Rereading the Iliad a third time is not not doing anything. I'm not pathetic.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know you're not.

Rune, yes, but in lieu of coming up with something that would immediately reduce the size of your thighs, why don't we get you a bigger pair of pants?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: And a different place to dress.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Definitely.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Well, can you get me the supply closet?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We'll take it by force if we have to. Go. Ah. [Rune leaves] Is everything under control?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye...no. This needs something and I cannot think of what it is.

Outside, as we speak, is a line of horse drawn sleighs and everybody gets a ride. So, uh, line up and keep it orderly. There's two per sleigh and no cutting in front of each other - that goes for everyone. Except me, 'cause I'll be damned if I'm gonna miss a ride in a horse drawn sleigh.

Yeah, I saw 'em.<\/p>\n<p>BOOTSY: I spent a summer training horses in Montana.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: You get kicked in the head a lot?<\/p>\n<p>BOOTSY: Just the once.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, you in the belt - get in.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What? Oh, no, I was just sort of checking things out.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Come on. We can pull a Ben Hur and take down Taylor's sleigh.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I don't know, I...<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Aww, come on Luke. I can't be all school marm-y and ride by myself. Please?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Well, okay. [gets in the sleigh]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Giddy up. [the sleigh starts moving] Uh! The horses heard me, I speak horse language! I'm Dr. Dolittle!<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Plus, I think the driver of the sleigh heard you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I gotta say, sleigh ride's a little much, but these horses are really beautiful.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, especially from this angle.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Not just from this angle.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh seriously, don't backtrack. Horse has got a nice butt there.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: It's not what I'm saying.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Nice firm hiney.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Stop talking about the horse's hiney.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: God, the town looks beautiful.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Same as always.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, it's always different his time of year. It's magical.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: If you say so, sure. Oh look, there's the magical plumbing supply store where I bought a magical float for my toilet last week.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You disappoint me.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Oh look. There's the magical Luke's Diner right underneath the apartment that Jess magically lit by leaving every stinkin' light on.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: How's it going with you guys?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Me and Jess? Great.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Great? Really?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Really.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, good.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: It is good. I mean, it was hard at first, seemed impossible, you know, but I've learned a lot these past couple months.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Like?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Like last week I discovered the secret of parenting.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You did?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Yup.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: The secret of parenting?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: The secret of parenting.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: When last week? Last Tuesday?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I don't know the exact day.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Tuesday at 5:15, is that when you discovered the secret of parenting?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Don't mock.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, tell me. What is. . . oh wait, it's a secret, you can't tell me.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: No, I'll tell you. You visualize the reality you want.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You visualize the reality you want.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: And then if necessary, you lie to bring it about.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That is so much worse than I was expecting.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: You never lied to your kid?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ahh, to save her from great physical pain, yes. When she was little and she would play in the kitchen, I told her that the burners were the devil's hands, but I would say it in a really scary evangelist voice, you know, 'Don't touch the devil's hands!' She still doesn't go near the stove.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Yes, exactly. You told a little white lie for your kid's protection, very similar to what I've done.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Which was?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Well, you know the winter break is coming up?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes I do.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Okay, well that means Jess has some time off from school. His mom knew that and she never called.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ugh, it makes me sick<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: So I decided just to keep Jess with me, and I told him that his mom wanted him to come home but I thought since he just got there and was still adjusting that I thought he should stay, and his mom was really upset but I insisted. He bought it hook, line and sinker. Saved him a lot of hurt.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: He didn't buy it.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What? Of course he did.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: He knows.<\/p>\n<p>[cut to Richard and Emily's sleigh]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I wish Lorelai had warned us about this.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: What? This is wonderful..<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It's wreaking havoc with my hair.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Oh this is not bad for your hair, compared to the other thing.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What other thing? [Richard tousles her hair] Richard, stop it! Stop it! Suddenly you're two years old.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Oh, I'm just having fun.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'm not complaining.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: This is fun too. This is like a roller coaster.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: A little.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Say, when was the last time we were on a roller coaster?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Never.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Didn't we ever go to Coney Island?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That must've been your other wife.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Gosh, I used to love it when I was a kid. They were a lot faster then too.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And less safe.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: We should go on one.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: A fast one.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Fine. You go and I'll wait and hold your cotton candy for you.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: You are going.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It would take a whole day.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: You are going.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'd be scared.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I'll hold your hand.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Fine. We'll go on a roller coaster.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Good.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Now where is this roller coaster we're going on?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I'm not sure. I'll get Rory to look it up on the Internet for us.<\/p>\n<p>[cut to Rory getting in a sleigh]<\/p>\n<p>DRIVER: That it miss?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I guess I'm alone.<\/p>\n<p>[The sleigh starts going. Jess jumps into the seat next to Rory]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What are you doing?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Well, I heard it was two to a sleigh - no more, no less. You were breaking the rules.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You could've hurt yourself.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I live on the edge. I can jump out if you want.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Doesn't matter to me.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Are you mad at me or something?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What do you think?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I can't read your mind.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You got into a fight with Dean.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Dean?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: My boyfriend.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Ah. He's still your boyfriend?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, you can jump out now.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I wasn't fighting him. I was fighting someone else. He jumped in on his own.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He was trying to help you.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Oh, he should go into government service if he's so interested in helping people. But me, he can stop worrying about.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why were you fighting in the first place?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: 'Cause Chuck Presby's a jerk.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You were fighting Chuck Presby?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, he is a jerk.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: This whole town is weird and full of jerks.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Then why are you still here?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: What do you mean?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I mean, school's out and you don't like it here, so why don't you just go home?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: My mom didn't want me to.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I don't believe that.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: That's your right, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Did Luke say she didn't want you to?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Luke told me it was his idea that I should stay. It wasn't his idea. That's good.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Your snowman. Snowwoman, actually.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You know which one is ours?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: It definitely has the most personality. Kind of looks like Bjork.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's what we were going for.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Yeah?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But everyone thinks the one on the end is gonna be the winner.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Really? It's so overdone.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I agree.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: You should win.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No argument.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Hey, what do you and Dean talk about?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I mean, does he know Bjork?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I've played him some stuff.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Hm. So you got a teacher-student thing going?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Stop.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: No, really, I'm curious. What do you guys talk about?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Everything.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Like?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Just everything, tons of stuff, whatever.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: It's just in the brief non-pugilistic time I've spent with him in class, he just doesn't seem like your kind of guy.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, he is my kind of guy. He's exactly my kind of guy.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Okay. I guess I don't know him that well.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You don't. You don't.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO INN DINING ROOM<\/p>\n<p>[All of the guests are seated at a long table. Lorelai stands at the head of the table with a camera.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Quiet please, everybody. Before the, uh, button popping and the bloating can commence, say cheese.<\/p>\n<p>EVERYONE: Cheese!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Uh, now, ladies and gentlemen, damen und herren, um, the moment you've been waiting for, I give you the Bracebridge Dinner.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Whoa, whoa, hold it. We just need a quick minute, please.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Which will be starting in one quick minute.<\/p>\n<p>BOOTSY: You ever think about that? You can't have a quick minute because it's always sixty seconds.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Shut up.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Lorelai darling, who is the silver fox with the tight kneesocks?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, that's Claude. He's one of our regular servers, divorced and on the market.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Oh, well the uniform is interesting.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: All right. I'll have him bathed, powdered, and sent to your room.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: What? Oh, you joke? Was that a joke?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Lorelai, this is just beautiful. It's like something out of Architectural Digest. You should be very proud.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thanks Dad.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Your dress needs pressing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thanks Mom.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai sits down next to Rory]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Your pod Grandpa is still happy as a clam.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: See, I told you this would be good for him.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: When you're right, you're right.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Welcome Lords and Ladies. I call upon these sprightly horns to commence our proceedings. [horns play] Hey Chuck Mangione, you wanna back up a step?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And we're off.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: And now, fair people, I present my Lord and Master, the honorable Squire Bracebridge.<\/p>\n<p>[Jackson enters the room dressed as the Squire]<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Lo! Now has come our joyfullest feast. Let every man be jolly.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: We should've eaten before we came.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Shh! And yeah.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Humble servant, bring us the first course to dine with pleasure. Mmm, methinks it be a butternut squash soup.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: Ah, methinks you're right Squire Bracebridge, thus and verily.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: And verily thus.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: They're the Old England Abbot and Costello.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: 'Tis perfection, but extremely hot.<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: My Lord, do you need aid? Wouldst thou have thee ice thy tongue?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Ah nay, Rune, nay. To the guests thou shall serve the soup!<\/p>\n<p>JESS: What's the white stuff?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I think it's cheese - or cream.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: And the green stuff?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I think it'sbest picked off.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: No one says grace?<\/p>\n<p>LANE: I think they all do Mama, uh, silently.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: Did you say silent grace?<\/p>\n<p>BABETTE: [laughs] Good one!<\/p>\n<p>[Mrs. Kim stares at her. Babette quickly bows her head and nudges for Morey to do the same. Cut to Kirk serving soup to Lorelai and Rory]<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: Soup for mi'ladies?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why thank you, kind sir.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey Kirk, nice blouse.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Don't let her make fun of you Kirk. You look great.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: Soup with garlands, gay and rosemary.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You're gonna stay in character no matter what, huh?<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: 'Tis hot, so proceed daintily.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, did you ever see that I Love Lucy where she goes to Buckingham Palace?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: She tries to get the palace guard to break character. That was a funny one.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: 'Tis foreign to me good lady.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hang in there, Kirk.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Those ones where she was in Europe, hands down, those were the best!<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: No way, the Hollywood ones!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ha!<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: Damn!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I was rooting for you boy.<\/p>\n<p>[Cut to later that evening]<\/p>\n<p>RUNE: My Lord, shall dessert be served?<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Anon, humble servant.<\/p>\n<p>CLARA: Can I eat my dessert with the horses?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Sure, uh, but put your coat on.<\/p>\n<p>CLARA: Are you okay?<\/p>\n<p>BOOTSY: I guess so. I've lost track of how many beers I've had.<\/p>\n<p>CLARA: Seven.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey Paris, how's it going?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Fine, good, thanks for having me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, it was our pleasure.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Did you notice the anachronisms?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: The what?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: The period discrepancies. They were pretty blatant. I mean, forget that the nineteenth century didn't include recessed lighting or the Fossil watch that your server was wearing, but water in that period would not have been served with cubed ice.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Right.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: And your servers are wearing nylon blend shirts, and nylon was invented by a scientist at Dupont in the 1920's. It shattered the illusion.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Floggings will be administered.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: So there we are, it's a beautiful moonlit Prague night, and we're strolling across the Charles Bridge when we come across this group of kids blasting this song by that. . .oh, that awful woman. Who is she? The tall bony one, married to the deceased mustachioed congressman.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Cher?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That's the one!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: The year of 'Do you believe in life after love?'<\/p>\n<p>RORY: A difficult time for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>MICHEL: I like that song.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Well, I was appalled. Prague has played host to some of the greatest composers in history. Mozart named a symphony after it, for heaven's sake. So what did I do?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I have tried so hard to forget this.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I stood beside them and their boombox and I hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony as loud as I could. [starts humming]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: A bizarro Battle of the Bands.<\/p>\n<p>TAYLOR: And did it work?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Well, they quickly packed up and went their way.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: But then he kept on humming the Mozart. He wouldn't stop.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Well, at that point I was hoping for some gullible tourists to drop money at my feet.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And two of them did.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: And I kept it!<\/p>\n<p>TAYLOR: You know, this might be the most interesting conversation I've ever had with an insurance man.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Aww, I'm hurt.<\/p>\n<p>TAYLOR: I'm sorry Richard. What I meant was that<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: No, what you meant was that people in the insurance industry are drones. Well I agree. They are a dull, dull lot, and I am glad to be rid of them.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rid of them?<\/p>\n<p>TAYLOR: Oh, are you retired Richard?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Well, uh<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Of course he's not. Richard? Richard?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Actually, I am.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BEDROOM<\/p>\n<p>[Later that evening, Lorelai and Rory are in their room at the inn getting ready for bed.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah, it's always nice to end a big festive meal with a big festive pall hanging over the room.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Most people didn't notice anything.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I guess. Bootsy singing Hotel California accompanied by spoons drew people's attention away.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Did Grandma and Grandpa say a word to each other the rest of the night?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why didn't he tell anyone?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm sorry, are you asking me to interpret my parents' motives?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: My mistake. So which bed do you want?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Take the one by the window.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay. [pulls back blanket] Mom!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What honey?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You put the picture of the ugly baby in my bed?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I didn't, I swear. That ugly baby is stalking us. Run away!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Poor baby, it's not his fault.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I think it's a she.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Poor baby, you picked the wrong parents. Hey, have you heard from Dad recently?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What dad - your dad?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, my dad.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Why?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Because he's my dad, and he usually checks in this time of year and he hasn't checked in yet. I mean, I know he's probably busy with Sherry and the new apartment and...what?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: There may have been a call.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: There may have been? You don't remember?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well things have been so hectic, you know, with the Bracebridge Dinner, and um, building a snowwoman, and planning the ugly baby gag, that took time.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, he called! He called, he called, he called and invited you, and it's not too late to go. He called and invited you, so there you go. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, so there.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He invited me over?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, are you deaf?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, I'm just trying to separate the gist from the ubububububah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, the gist is he invited you, okay?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why didn't he invite me himself?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Because he's pretending to be considerate by running it past me first.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Was he maybe not pretending to be considerate, and actually being considerate?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Maybe. But I wouldn't put it past him to be inconsiderate. The guy doesn't have the greatest track record.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why didn't you tell me this? He's probably waiting for my answer, and holding off making plans.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Because I have dibs on this time of year with you, not him! Me! And yes, he acknowledged that, and that was cool and all, but still - it stinks! Because he put me in a very difficult position because we were supposed to watch a lot of movies and make fun of Godfather 3, and the thing that I really, really hate about this isis the idea of you not hanging out with me because you're hanging out there with your stupid stepmother.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're calling Sherry my stepmother?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, she practically is.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're wigging.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: There is something wrong with that woman.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You don't even know her.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You think I'm overreacting?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I think you're jealous of Sherry.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ha, I'm not jealous of Sherry.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But I understand - your territory has been threatened.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Excuse me?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But relax, there are ways to work through situations like this - compromises can be struck.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, what are you saying?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, you know, I can still call you Mom, and I'll call her Mommy Sherry.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Don't be mean.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And we can split up holidays evenly. Like, I'll be with you on Labor Day<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: her on Memorial Day.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Enough.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'll have to find out about her religion though to see how Chanukah will factor into this, unless you want to convert to Judaism and then take over Chanukah for yourself.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I get the point. I overreacted. Please stop.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You totally overreacted. God.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So do you think you're gonna go and stay with them?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'll have to think about it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Do you have to think about it because you know that it's killing me not to know whether you're going or not and you want to torture me like that?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Nope, I just don't know if I want to do it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It was nice of him to ask though.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It was very nice.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: 'Cause we are rooting for Dad.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We are rooting for him. It was a very nice thing that Christopher offered. I was being a little possessive.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And insanely jealous of his pretty girlfriend.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I wanna know if she's good enough for him.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Me too.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So there was an altruistic streak to my madness.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: We'll go with that.<\/p>\n<p>[there's a knock at the door. Lorelai answers, Emily is there.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I need a new room.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I can't stay in that room.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: There are no other rooms, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, then I'll go home.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Grandma, it's late.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And pitch black, and the roads are icy. You can't be driving.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, I'm not going back to that room.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm guessing you and Dad had it out about the job thing?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We haven't even spoken since dinner. I'm so upset, I wouldn't know where to begin. And I couldn't take being around him anymore. What he did is inexcusable. Not letting me know he left his job - as if it didn't affect me?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Aw mom, try to calm down. Here, take this bed, and Rory and I will share.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'm just a burden.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You're not a burden, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, okay, thank you. Can I use the mirror in the bathroom for a second?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, I'll use the one out here.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory watches as Lorelai and Emily both apply cream to their face]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Behold my future.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: How do you turn out the light?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'll get it.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I still can't believe it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Try to relax Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I hope he doesn't sleep because I surely won't.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: These slippers you have here are hardly one size fits all. They're too big.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Goodnight.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It was so irresponsible.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Maybe he had no choice.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Of course he had a choice. Go to sleep Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That job was killing him, Mom. It was killing him.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'm going for a little walk.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Grandma, it's late.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'm not tired.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Gilmores of our lives.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LOBBY<\/p>\n<p>[Emily walks in and finds Richard sitting on the sofa]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I didn't know you were here.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Emily, don't go.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'm very tired.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I want to talk to you, please. I don't need to remind you about how I've been feeling at work, and my frustration just built to the point whereagain, you know this. So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time with my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest. I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me, and I realized it was because I was smiling. Well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time. I was. . .I was happy.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And you chose not to tell me? Your own wife.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Oh Emily, I know I've done nothing but disappoint you these past few months, what with how isolated I've become and all the social engagements I've made you cancel, and all the friendships I've jeopardized. And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options. Not a terribly significant amount, but an amount all the same.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Richard, let's just go to bed.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LOBBY<\/p>\n<p>[The next morning, the guests are leaving]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: See ya Bootsy.<\/p>\n<p>BOOTSY: See ya, thanks. By the way, last night did I sing Hotel California?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: From beginning to end.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: While banging spoons on your head.<\/p>\n<p>BOOTSY: Well that explains the lumps.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Bye.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Lorelai, darling, oh thank you for everything.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Patty, your timing is excellent. There's Claude over there. Want me to do some matchmaking?<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Aww, he's wearing a golf shirt and cotton Dockers.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So it was the uniform, huh?<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Aw, it's the Biloxi Naval Base all over again.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: See ya.<\/p>\n<p>MISS PATTY: Bye.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey Mom. You didn't make it back to the room last night. Did you get lucky?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Could you be any cruder?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, I can be cruder. Hey mom, did you get la<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thanks for coming! It was fun. Is everything okay?<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Everything's okay.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We'll see you next Friday.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Bye. Bye Dad.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Bye Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: You just had one grub too many. Just drink lots of water to rehydrate.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: I will.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Jackson, thank you for being our Squire.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Oh, you're welcome. Hey, uh, by the way, last night when Bootsy was singing Hotel California and banging spoons on his head, did I<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Lift up your shirt and play drums on your stomach? Yes you did.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Oh boy.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You kept a good beat.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Yeah, 'cause God knows if the beat was off, you'd have embarrassed yourself.<\/p>\n<p>CLARA: Thanks Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Clara, I'm glad you came.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: So I'll see you later.<\/p>\n<p>CLARA: Don't kiss.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Aw, come on.<\/p>\n<p>CLARA: Don't kiss.<\/p>\n<p>[Dean covers Clara's eyes while he kisses Rory]<\/p>\n<p>CLARA: Come on.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: So I guess we're off.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I guess so.<\/p>\n<p>[Dean walks away, then glances back and sees Rory and Jess smiling at each other]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Bye you guys. Ugh, let's go home.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Are we coming to get our bags later?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Why?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Because we're walking home.

It gives her a unique expression.\nRORY: Like she had a stroke?\nLORELAI: Fine, I'll just use the Mrs. Potato Head lips.\nRORY: No, forget it, leave stroke-mouth. It's not like we're gonna win this anyway.\nLORELAI: Whoa, bad attitude.\nRORY: Mom, face it. That is the single most incredible snowman I have ever seen. [looks at a man working on an elaborate snow sculpture]\nLORELAI: I'm sorry, that snowman is way over the top, way too showy. It's screaming 'I'm incredible, I'm special, look at me.'\nRORY: Kind of the point of a snowman-building contest.\nLORELAI: Hmm, I hate this man with every fiber of my being.\nRORY: He looks nice.\nLORELAI: He's a ringer.\nRORY: How do you figure?\nLORELAI: Someone recruited him, promised him a handsome sum, financed his theatrical snowman accoutrements, so he could snatch victory away from a deserving local in order to bag the contest prize for himself.\nRORY: Seems a little elaborate considering that the prize is a set of new US quarters.\nLORELAI: Oh, we're ignoring him now. So, what are we gonna do on your school break?\nRORY: A lot of nothing.\nLORELAI: Sounds good.\nRORY: Plus some homework.\nLORELAI: And a lot of movies.\nRORY: Oh, we have to rent Godfather 3 on DVD.\nLORELAI: You're kidding.\nRORY: In the audio commentary, Coppola actually defends casting Sofia.\nLORELAI: Now that is fatherly love. What's all this homework you have to do?\nRORY: Just stuff for the paper.\nLORELAI: What? Why?\nRORY: Because Paris wants the first issue back to be a double issue, so we have to prep over break and she says the news never sleeps.\nLORELAI: What about Paris, does she ever sleep?\nRORY: I think she periodically makes a whirring noise and then just shuts down.\nLORELAI: Well, you can't work the whole time.\nRORY: I won't, I promise. Oh my God.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: He's power buffing.\nLORELAI: Aw, now that is just wrong.\nRORY: We're competing against the Michelangelo of snow.\nLORELAI: And we're Ernest Builds a Snowman.\nRORY: We shouldn't look at him anymore.\nLORELAI: Heads down, stay focused.\nRORY: We can do this.\nLORELAI: Absolutely.\n[their snowman's head falls off]\nRORY: Let's get some coffee?\nLORELAI: Right behind you.\nOPENING CREDITS\nCUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN\n[Michel is at the front desk on the phone. In the background, Rune is jumping up and down trying to dust a picture frame.]\nMICHEL: [oh phone] Yes, you can rent a car in Manhattan and return it in Hartford. That'sthat's no problem, sir. Yes. Yes, you can return it to Bradley International. That'sthat's very convenient. Or youyou canum, you - hold please. [puts phone down, walks over to Rune and grabs his arm]\nRUNE: Ah!\nMICHEL: Stop that.\nRUNE: Stop what?\nMICHEL: Stop jumping like a Mexican bean.\nRUNE: Well, Lorelai asked me to dust the picture frames. How do you suggest that I clean the top, smartie? [Michel takes the picture off the wall] Well, I didn't know that you could do that.\nMICHEL: Yes, I am miraculously talented, aren't I?\nRUNE: I thought an alarm would go off like in The Thomas Crown Affair.\nMICHEL: That would be if this was a museum, and you were a man allowed in museums.\nLORELAI: Hey, no bickering in the lobby, guys.\nRUNE: Where are we allowed to bicker?\nCUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN\nSOOKIE: You've got all the mushrooms? You double checked?\nJACKSON: I've triple checked. I've quadruple checked.\nSOOKIE: The shitake, the nameko, the chanterelle?\nJACKSON: Once again, I've got it all.\nSOOKIE: The matsutake? The makeniya?\nJACKSON: Uh wait.\nSOOKIE: What?\nJACKSON: I don't have makeniya.\nSOOKIE: You don't have makeniya?\nJACKSON: I don't have makeniya.\nSOOKIE: I made it up. [giggles] You passed the test.\nJACKSON: Don't test me.\n[Lorelai walks in the kitchen]\nLORELAI: Hey, the auditions are starting. You wanna come watch?\nSOOKIE: Ooh, yes!\nJACKSON: Auditions for what?\nSOOKIE: Musicians.\nLORELAI: For the Bracebridge Dinner.\nJACKSON: Geez, you guys are going crazy with this dinner.\nSOOKIE: Jackson, I told you, this dinner is not just about food. We are recreating an authentic 19th century meal.\nLORELAI: The servers are all gonna be in period clothing, they're gonna speak period English. Here, look at the costumes.\nJACKSON: Nice.\nSOOKIE: We're talking seven courses here. Soup, fish, Peacock Pie, the Baron of Beef, the salad, then the Plum Pudding and the Wassail.\nLORELAI: And there's gonna be a big raised platform where the Squire of Bracebridge is going to preside over the festivities.\nSOOKIE: Yeah, he tastes the foods and makes pronouncements. He's like the host of the evening, and his costume is the coolest.\nLORELAI: Ah.\nJACKSON: It all sounds great.\nSOOKIE: Oh, it is, it is. By the way, you're playing Squire Bracebridge. Ready?\nLORELAI: Let's go.\nSOOKIE: Yeah. [they leave]\nJACKSON: Huh? What was that?\nCUT TO LOBBY\nSOOKIE: What are we looking at today?\nLORELAI: Okay, this is the last on our list. We've already got our trumpets, our madrigal singers\nJACKSON: Uh, sorry to interrupt but I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge.\nLORELAI: We've got all our servers lined up. This is just for recorder players and harpists. Hi. Uh, lay some on us guys.\n[two recorder players play]\nSOOKIE: Hey, you cats really know how to blow those things.\nLORELAI: You've got the gig. I will call you later with the details. Thanks.\n[the recorder players leave]\nJACKSON: So are we clear on this? I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge. Sorry you were under the impression that I'd do this.\nSOOKIE: When do the guests arrive?\nLORELAI: Thursday at four - on their own jet.\nSOOKIE: After buying out the whole inn.\nLORELAI: Must be nice to have money.\nSOOKIE: Uh! Hey, you know what struck me today?\nJACKSON: Was it the fact that I'm not the Squire - did that strike you?\nSOOKIE: We are crazy for doing this.\nLORELAI: We're beyond crazy. We are 'Anne Heche speaking her secret language to God and looking for the spaceship in Fresno' crazy.\nSOOKIE: Oh Quiness, nokka don atta.\nLORELAI: Il ek notra doska donne.\nJACKSON: And springing this on me at the last minute too, I mean, that's just manipulative.\n[a chef comes out of the kitchen]\nCHEF: Sookie, fire! [leaves]\nSOOKIE: I gotta get back in the kitchen. You'll handle the harp?\nLORELAI: You got it.\nJACKSON: All right, okay, I'll do it. I'll play Squire Bracebridge if that's what you want. Geez.\nSOOKIE: Thanks Sweetie. [walks to kitchen]\nJACKSON: As long as it's not just because I fit the costume. It's because I fit the costume, isn't it? [leaves]\nLORELAI: [to harpist] Go ahead.\n[Lorelai's cell phone rings while the harpist is playing]\nLORELAI: [answers phone] Hi, it's Lorelai.\nCHRISTOPHER: Hey Lor, it's me.\nLORELAI: Oh, hi Chris, how are you?\nCHRISTOPHER: Good, good. You, uh, got a minute?\nLORELAI: Uh oh.\nCHRISTOPHER: It's not an uh oh, I just wanted to run an idea by you.\nLORELAI: Run it.\nCHRISTOPHER: Now it's totally your call and I don't want to step on any plans you've already made, but I know Rory has a break in school coming up, and I was wondering if you'd be cool with her coming to visit for a couple of days.\nLORELAI: Uhh, a couple of days? You mean she'd stay the night?\nCHRISTOPHER: Yeah, it's totally your call. Where are you, heaven?\nLORELAI: Do you even have room for someone to stay?\nCHRISTOPHER: Not just room - a room. A designated guest room. Sherry fixed it up really nice.\nLORELAI: Aww, good for her.\nCHRISTOPHER: So what do you think?\nLORELAI: I don't know. It's awfully last minute.\nCHRISTOPHER: It's totally last minute. You can say no and there'll be no hard feelings.\nLORELAI: Well, it's really up to Rory to say yes or no.\nCHRISTOPHER: So you're cool with it?\nLORELAI: Yeah, sure, if Rory is, yeah.\nCHRISTOPHER: Great, that's great. Uh, thank you. I'll let you run it past her and you can get back to me whenever. No pressure.\nLORELAI: No pressure.\nCHRISTOPHER: Talk to you later.\nLORELAI: Yeah, talk to you later.\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Emily, Richard, Lorelai and Rory are eating dinner silently. Rory get Lorelai's attention and gestures for her to say something.]\nLORELAI: So what are your travel plans Dad?\nRICHARD: Hmm?\nLORELAI: You and mom, you always go out of town this time of year.\nRORY: Last year it was the Bahamas.\nRICHARD: Yes, that's right, it was.\nLORELAI: I remember you had fun too. You said the Bahamamians were real nice. The Bahamites? The Bahamamamamians?\nRORY: The Bahamians.\nLORELAI: Yes. They were nice.\nEMILY: They were nice.\nLORELAI: So, what are your plans?\nEMILY: We're not going anywhere this year.\nRORY: Why not? Oh, well yeah, it can be really nice just to stay at home sometimes because you can do fun things that you normally wouldn't have time for.\nLORELAI: Yeah, like play Running Charades, and get out that Slip 'n Slide.\nRICHARD: We'll see.\nEMILY: Yes, we'll see.\nRICHARD: Would you all excuse me? I have to make some calls. Say goodbye before you leave, will you?\nLORELAI: Yeah, sure Dad.\n[Richard leaves]\nLORELAI: When is this awfulness with work gonna resolve itself?\nEMILY: I don't know. The man is so sensitive. He reads so much into every little perceived slight.\nLORELAI: Yeah. I remember one time when I was a kid, Dad had put on some weight, and he bought a new suit to try to cover it up. And he wore it for us and he said, 'How do I look?' and I said, 'You look fat.' [pause] But I guess that wasn't really a perceived slightso, I'll think of another example.\nCUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN LOBBY\n[Sookie is lecturing to a group of people; Kirk is transcribing everything she says on his laptop.]\nSOOKIE: Keep in mind during the Bracebridge Dinner, we are not just servers, we are performers, so any time you're with a guest, you must be in character and you must speak Old English. It's a world we're creating here, so whatever we can doKirk, you're driving me crazy!\nKIRK: Who me? [reads transcript] 'Whatever we can do to Kirk you're driving me crazy.' Yeah, me. Ah, sorry.\nSOOKIE: Okay, now guys, look at the materials I gave you, and tell me if a guest asks you how the food's coming, what would be the appropriate Old English response? Rune!\nRUNE: Greetings!\nSOOKIE: You just read the first thing on the list, didn't you?\nRUNE: Maybe.\nSOOKIE: Guys, the correct response: Ah, oven's day with baked meat choke!\nRUNE: Question?\nSOOKIE: Yeah?\nRUNE: What color dress will I be wearing when I say this?\nJACKSON: Rune, don't be an idiot.\nRUNE: Well, this is stupid.\nJACKSON: Shut up and pay attention to Sookie. She worked very hard to bring this about.\nKIRK: Yes, but unfortunately we don't all share intimacies with her, so she doesn't cut us any slack.\nJACKSON: She doesn't treat me differently.\nKIRK: She's called you Peaches three times. It's all in the transcript.\nRUNE: Sookie, instead of talking in Old English, can I just talk like an old man?\nSOOKIE: What?\nRUNE: Hey you kids, get off my lawn!\nSOOKIE: No, no you cannot just talk like an old man.\n[Lorelai walks into the lobby]\nSOOKIE: Hi, honey, what's the matter?\nLORELAI: They're snowed in.\nSOOKIE: Who's snowed in?\nLORELAI: The Bracebridge group. They're stuck in Chicago. The dinner's off.\nSOOKIE: No.\nLORELAI: Yes.\nSOOKIE: I'm gonna cry.\nLORELAI: I offered to fund the instant invention of a molecular transport device but they just didn't go for it.\nSOOKIE: Oh, that makes me so mad. And so sad. I'm smad!\nRUNE: Sookie, does this mean that my pockets wileth not with money get choked? That sounded like Old English. Cool, huh?\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai, Sookie, and Rory are sitting at a table]\nSOOKIE: I've got thirty pounds of aged beef, trays and trays of trout, mountains of pruned tarts. I diced pumpkins until my hands turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands.\nLORELAI: Take a sip\nSOOKIE: How can you stay so calm about this?\nLORELAI: There's nothing we can do about it.\nRORY: I can't believe they got snowed in.\nLORELAI: All that work, all that extra help we hired. Oh well. At least they paid for it already. We didn't lose any money.\nSOOKIE: Yeah I guess. You know, I could still make up the dinner for the three of us.\nRORY: Yeah, but then it would be like the three of us, all alone in the dining room.\nLORELAI: It would be like The Shining, except instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune.\n[Luke walks over to them]\nLUKE: You girls want anything besides coffee?\nSOOKIE: Hey, what about Luke?\nLUKE: What about him?\nSOOKIE: He eats, and Jess eats. Doesn't Jess eat?\nLUKE: What's she doing?\nLORELAI: I think she's inviting you for dinner.\nSOOKIE: Yeah, come on, join us. It'll be fun. You like Peacock Pie?\nLUKE: I'm a hundred percent sure I don't.\nLORELAI: There'll be normal food too.\nRORY: And decorations.\nSOOKIE: And music.\nLORELAI: Come on, it'll be fun.\nLUKE: Well\nLORELAI: Hey, you know what? Let's invite everyone.\nSOOKIE: Everyone who?\nLORELAI: Everyone everyone.\nSOOKIE: Everyone everyone who?\nLORELAI: Everyone we know, everyone we like.\nRORY: And they could even stay in the inn. All those empty rooms, all those uneaten pillow mints.\nLORELAI: An out of control, over the top slumber party!\nSOOKIE: I love it!\nRORY: Me too!\nLORELAI: Done! Spread the word.\nLUKE: I haven't said I'd come yet so I'm certainly not gonna suddenly become your messenger boy. [Lorelai stares at him] Eight o'clock?\nLORELAI: Seven.\nLUKE: Right.\nCUT TO FRONT OF STARS HOLLOW HIGH\n[Dean walks out of the school, Lane walks over to him.]\nLANE: Deano.\nDEAN: Hey Lane. Are you going to this big shindig at the inn tonight?\nLANE: Yeah, I'm just trying to trick my mom into not going with me.\nDEAN: How's that coming along?\nLANE: How's that Pixies reunion coming along?\nDEAN: Well, I'll see you and your mom there.\nLANE: Bye.\nDEAN: Bye.\n[Lane leaves. Dean sees Jess fighting with another kid and goes over to break it up.]\nBOY: Keep it up pal, you'll get hurt.\nDEAN: Whoa, hey guys! Guys, come on, break it up guys! Quit it! Hey, hold it man, get off me! [Dean tries to pull Jess away; Jess tries to punch him] Whoa, hey, get off me man, I'm not fighting you! Jess, knock it off man! What the hell is your problem?\nJESS: Nothing.\nDEAN: You saw it was me, Jess. Why'd you keep punching?\nJESS: Had momentum.\nDEAN: Well I was trying to help you.\nJESS: I don't need you help, but thanks for offering.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai sits on the couch as Rory walks in with some drinks.]\nLORELAI: Hey, did Bootsy RSVP?\nRORY: Yeah, he's coming.\nLORELAI: Thanks. Is he bringing anybody?\nRORY: He's coming solo.\nLORELAI: Okay. I'm gonna put him in room 16 with Luke.\nRORY: You can't do that.\nLORELAI: Come on, let me have my fun.\nRORY: Luke's coming with Jess.\nLORELAI: Well, I'll put Jess in with Miss Patty.\nRORY: There will be no Jess left in the morning.\nLORELAI: You stink.\n[Rory sits in the armchair and picks up a pile of cards]\nRORY: Are these last year's cards or this year's?\nLORELAI: This year's, of course.\nRORY: Don't scoff. Last year's set were still sitting here 'til Halloween.\nLORELAI: Hey, if that's a crack at my housekeeping skills...well then, okay.\nRORY: Wow.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: This is one ugly looking baby. Whose baby is this?\nLORELAI: That's your second cousin's Stan's. Poor kid.\nRORY: Ugh, he got Stan's everything.\nLORELAI: That's not even the ugliest baby in the bunch.\nRORY: You're kidding. [looks through the pile] Ouch!\nLORELAI: That's the ugliest baby in the bunch.\nRORY: I don't understand why people put pictures on cards.\nLORELAI: Do they not understand we are unapologetic mockers?\nRORY: There's an unexplained innocence in the world. Hey, I didn't see this.\nLORELAI: See what?\nRORY: Dad.\nLORELAI: Oh.\nRORY: And the woman I'm assuming is Sherry.\nLORELAI: Uh, did I not show you that? Huh.\nRORY: They've got a cute little puppy and everything.\nLORELAI: Oh, I must've put it in the stack and forgotten to tell you about it. Well, there it is.\nRORY: Nice looking lady.\nLORELAI: Mm hmm. Like a young Tammy Faye Baker.\nRORY: But prettier than that.\nLORELAI: Oh, I didn't mean not pretty. Hey, question about the room list.\nRORY: Yeah?\nLORELAI: Room 31 - why is it empty?\nRORY: Oh yeah, I wanted to run an idea by you.\nLORELAI: Run it.\nRORY: I thought maybe a certain depressed man and his wife could stay there.\nLORELAI: Woody and Soon-Yi?\nRORY: Grandma and Grandpa.\nLORELAI: Ugh, you've got to be kidding.\nRORY: But this could help to cheer him up.\nLORELAI: I'll send him a Def Jam Comedy tape. That'll cheer him up.\nRORY: It's a really good thing to do.\nLORELAI: We'll donate money to charity, that's a good thing too. We'll stop kicking dogs.\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: All right, I'll pencil them in, but they'll probably say no.\nRORY: Yeah, but we're not gonna hope that they say no, right?\nLORELAI: Right.\nRORY: Right, because that would be really bad karma, especially on top of making fun of the ugly babies.\nLORELAI: Uh, I have a new year's resolution for you: become more cynical and self absorbed.\nRORY: I'll work on it.\nCUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN\n[The night of the Bracebridge Dinner, Lorelai and Rory are in the lobby]\nRORY: Hey, how's Sookie doing in there?\nLORELAI: Ah, well, she's paper bagging it.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: You know... [Lorelai breathes into a pretend paper bag]\nRORY: Oh, so she's right on schedule.\n[Babette and Morey walk into the inn.]\nBABETTE: Hey dolls.\nLORELAI: Hey!\nRORY: Hi, welcome.\nMOREY: Are we the first ones here?\nLORELAI: Yes, you are.\nBABETTE: Now don't you freak out. Morey hates being the first anywhere. He thinks it hurts his street credibility.\nMOREY: Charlie Parker was late to everything.\nBABETTE: Charlie Parker had more drugs in him than a Rite-Aid. Forget Charlie Parker.\nRORY: You guys are in room 8. It's all ready for you.\nBABETTE: Thanks, doll. C'mon Morey. We can be late for dinner if it'll make you feel better.\nMOREY: A little.\nBABETTE: Yeah.\n[they walk away as Lane walks into the inn]\nLANE: Hey!\nRORY: Are you alone?\nMRS. KIM: Lane!\nLANE: My wedding night's gonna be very interesting.\nRORY: Hi Mrs. Kim. I'm glad you guys could come. You guys are in room 12.\nMRS. KIM: Thank you. Hello Lorelai, thank you for inviting us.\nLORELAI: Our pleasure. Do you need help bringing in the rest of your stuff?\nMRS. KIM: This is my stuff. Don't need any more stuff. People have too much stuff.\nLORELAI: You know you're right. People have too much stuff. Absolutely.\n[Mrs. Kim and Lane walk away]\nRORY: Says the woman with 64 pairs of shoes.\nLORELAI: Thus proving my point. What is Paris doing here?\nRORY: She had to bring me the newspaper stuff tonight. She just couldn't wait.\nLORELAI: A robot, she's a robot. Hi! [walks away]\nRORY: Hey.\nPARIS: So here are the materials in the double issue. Some of the articles are gonna need complete rewrites.\nRORY: Drag.\nPARIS: Madeline's 500 words on test anxiety spends 400 of them arguing that stretch corduroy is the best material for low-rise jeans.\nRORY: Well, let's see. Corduroy is a fabric, and the fabric of society is weakened when students\nPARIS: You can't get there.\nRORY: Yeah, it doesn't look like it. I'll get right on this tomorrow.\nPARIS: What about tonight?\nRORY: I'm busy tonight.\nPARIS: Doing what?\nRORY: Well, this.\nPARIS: Oh. What is this?\nRORY: It's kind of a big dinner party.\nPARIS: Oh. Okay, well, I'll get out of your way. Call if you need to talk things through, and oh - she uses the Prince version of writing. A letter U for you and a picture of an eye for an I.\nRORY: Wow.\nPARIS: Yeah.\nRORY: Hey Paris, do you have anything going on tonight?\nPARIS: What's that supposed to mean?\nRORY: It's supposed to mean, do you have anything going on tonight?\nPARIS: Well, my parents are out of town, so my Portuguese nanny will make dinner and then I'll either get back to reading the Iliad or we'll play Monopoly. I crush her every time.\nRORY: Well I was just thinking, maybe you want to stay for dinner?\nPARIS: Here?\nRORY: Yeah. We have a ton of food, and it's like a whole big show and everything, and if you're not doing anything\nPARIS: Rereading the Iliad a third time is not not doing anything. I'm not pathetic.\nRORY: I know you're not. I just thought it might be fun, that's all.\nPARIS: Well, I'll have to make a call.\nRORY: Good, make it.\nPARIS: I just have to let Nanny know. [takes out cell phone and dials] Nanny? É Paris. Vou jantar com Rory hoje à noite. Eu telefono no caminho de casa. Tchau.\n[Dean and Clara walk into the inn]\nDEAN: Hey.\nRORY: Hello there. Hey Clara. Nice, is that a Stella McCartney?\nCLARA: It's a Wal-Mart.\nRORY: Well, it's very pretty.\nCLARA: My mom bought it for tonight.\nRORY: She's got good taste.\nDEAN: [sees Jess walk in] I didn't know he was coming.\nRORY: Who?\nDEAN: Jess.\nRORY: Yeah. Is that a problem?\nDEAN: Not really.\nRORY: Dean.\nDEAN: It's just that, he got into this fight with this guy at school, and when I broke it up he started in on me.\nRORY: He hit you?\nDEAN: He tried.\nRORY: Why would he do that?\nDEAN: Don't ask me to explain that jerk. [Jess waves] He better not do that all night.\nCUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN\nSOOKIE: No! It tastes too twentieth century guys. It's gotta shout Washington Irving, not Irving my accountant. It needs something, help me. What is it?\nCHEF: Uhh\n[Lorelai walks in]\nLORELAI: How's it going? AGH!\nSOOKIE: What?\nLORELAI: Ooh! Ew, Rune naked, naked Rune.\n[Rune is changing his pants in the corner]\nSOOKIE: Ahh!\nRUNE: These stupid pants won't go past my thighs.\nLORELAI: Why are you dressing in here?\nRUNE: The bathrooms are full and the lousy madrigal singers are bull guarding the supply closet so this is the only place.\nSOOKIE: They're too small.\nRUNE: My thighs are too big.\nLORELAI: Ahh! Rune, yes, but in lieu of coming up with something that would immediately reduce the size of your thighs, why don't we get you a bigger pair of pants?\nSOOKIE: And a different place to dress.\nLORELAI: Definitely.\nRUNE: Well, can you get me the supply closet?\nLORELAI: We'll take it by force if we have to. Go. Ah. [Rune leaves] Is everything under control?\nSOOKIE: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye...no. This needs something and I cannot think of what it is. It's that tart, kind of spicy, white. . .salt! The word is salt!\nLORELAI: You forgot the word for salt?\nSOOKIE: Everything's under control.\nLORELAI: Good.\nSOOKIE: Absolutely, one hundred percent.\nLORELAI: You're exuding confidence. Have the oxygen ready.\nSOOKIE: Okay, easy. It's a bird, it's a bird.\nCUT TO LOBBY\n[Lorelai walks into the lobby as Emily and Richard arrive]\nLORELAI: They're here.\nRORY: Who?\nLORELAI: The Joy-less Luck Club.\nRICHARD: Hello girls. You look particularly lovely tonight.\nRORY: Thanks Grandpa.\nLORELAI: Thanks Dad. You guys look nice yourselves.\nEMILY: Seems like the occasion called for it.\nRICHARD: The air seems crisper here than Hartford. It's wonderful.\nLORELAI: Hey Dad, you didn't grab the wrong prescription bottle earlier today, did you?\nRICHARD: What?\nRORY: Nothing.\nEMILY: I think she was making one of her funny jokes.\nRICHARD: Oh, went straight over my head.\nLORELAI: Let me get someone to help you with your bags.\nRICHARD: No, no, I've got them. Just point me to the room.\nRORY: You guys are in room 31, best room in the place.\nRICHARD: Oh, anything's fine. I'll, uh, see you in a bit. [walks away]\nLORELAI: What got into him?\nRORY: He's totally different.\nEMILY: I know. He's been that way for two days. I have no idea why but I'm taking the credit.\nLORELAI: Ugh, a hostess' job is never done. Hi.\nCUT TO LOBBY\n[All the guests are mingling in the lobby.]\nLORELAI: Hey everybody, will you gather round? Everyone, everyone! First of all, I want to welcome you to the first annual and probably never ever to be held again because Sookie's on the verge of a nervous breakdown Bracebridge Dinner.\nSOOKIE: I'm fine, everything's fine.\nLORELAI: I also want to thank Mother Nature for snowing in the Trelling Paper Company in Chicago so I can throw this great party for all my friends instead. It's a very special night. And so, since I don't get to eat unbelievably strange food with my friends everyday, I have arranged a little surprise. Outside, as we speak, is a line of horse drawn sleighs and everybody gets a ride. So, uh, line up and keep it orderly. There's two per sleigh and no cutting in front of each other - that goes for everyone. Except me, 'cause I'll be damned if I'm gonna miss a ride in a horse drawn sleigh. Come on.\nLUKE: You gonna go?\nJESS: I think I'll wait for the clog dancing.\nDEAN: Hey, hey, don't move.\nCLARA: But we're gonna miss all the good horses!\nRORY: Who is this brazen woman competing for your attention?\nCLARA: Come on!\nDEAN: Uh, I guess I'm spoken for.\nRORY: I'll see you back here.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai is sitting in one of the sleighs as Luke and Bootsy stand near the horses]\nBOOTSY: You see the horses?\nLUKE: You mean the ones three feet from my face? Yeah, I saw 'em.\nBOOTSY: I spent a summer training horses in Montana.\nLUKE: You get kicked in the head a lot?\nBOOTSY: Just the once.\nLORELAI: Hey, you in the belt - get in.\nLUKE: What? Oh, no, I was just sort of checking things out.\nLORELAI: Come on. We can pull a Ben Hur and take down Taylor's sleigh.\nLUKE: I don't know, I...\nLORELAI: Aww, come on Luke. I can't be all school marm-y and ride by myself. Please?\nLUKE: Well, okay. [gets in the sleigh]\nLORELAI: Giddy up. [the sleigh starts moving] Uh! The horses heard me, I speak horse language! I'm Dr. Dolittle!\nLUKE: Plus, I think the driver of the sleigh heard you.\nLORELAI: Oh, yeah.\nLUKE: I gotta say, sleigh ride's a little much, but these horses are really beautiful.\nLORELAI: Yes, especially from this angle.\nLUKE: Not just from this angle.\nLORELAI: Oh seriously, don't backtrack. Horse has got a nice butt there.\nLUKE: It's not what I'm saying.\nLORELAI: Nice firm hiney.\nLUKE: Stop talking about the horse's hiney.\nLORELAI: God, the town looks beautiful.\nLUKE: Same as always.\nLORELAI: No, it's always different his time of year. It's magical.\nLUKE: If you say so, sure. Oh look, there's the magical plumbing supply store where I bought a magical float for my toilet last week.\nLORELAI: You disappoint me.\nLUKE: Oh look. There's the magical Luke's Diner right underneath the apartment that Jess magically lit by leaving every stinkin' light on.\nLORELAI: How's it going with you guys?\nLUKE: Me and Jess? Great.\nLORELAI: Great? Really?\nLUKE: Really.\nLORELAI: Well, good.\nLUKE: It is good. I mean, it was hard at first, seemed impossible, you know, but I've learned a lot these past couple months.\nLORELAI: Like?\nLUKE: Like last week I discovered the secret of parenting.\nLORELAI: You did?\nLUKE: Yup.\nLORELAI: The secret of parenting?\nLUKE: The secret of parenting.\nLORELAI: When last week? Last Tuesday?\nLUKE: I don't know the exact day.\nLORELAI: Tuesday at 5:15, is that when you discovered the secret of parenting?\nLUKE: Don't mock.\nLORELAI: Well, tell me. What is. . . oh wait, it's a secret, you can't tell me.\nLUKE: No, I'll tell you. You visualize the reality you want.\nLORELAI: You visualize the reality you want.\nLUKE: And then if necessary, you lie to bring it about.\nLORELAI: That is so much worse than I was expecting.\nLUKE: You never lied to your kid?\nLORELAI: Ahh, to save her from great physical pain, yes. When she was little and she would play in the kitchen, I told her that the burners were the devil's hands, but I would say it in a really scary evangelist voice, you know, 'Don't touch the devil's hands!' She still doesn't go near the stove.\nLUKE: Yes, exactly. You told a little white lie for your kid's protection, very similar to what I've done.\nLORELAI: Which was?\nLUKE: Well, you know the winter break is coming up?\nLORELAI: Yes I do.\nLUKE: Okay, well that means Jess has some time off from school. His mom knew that and she never called.\nLORELAI: Ugh, it makes me sick\nLUKE: So I decided just to keep Jess with me, and I told him that his mom wanted him to come home but I thought since he just got there and was still adjusting that I thought he should stay, and his mom was really upset but I insisted. He bought it hook, line and sinker. Saved him a lot of hurt.\nLORELAI: He didn't buy it.\nLUKE: What? Of course he did.\nLORELAI: He knows.\n[cut to Richard and Emily's sleigh]\nEMILY: I wish Lorelai had warned us about this.\nRICHARD: What? This is wonderful..\nEMILY: It's wreaking havoc with my hair.\nRICHARD: Oh this is not bad for your hair, compared to the other thing.\nEMILY: What other thing? [Richard tousles her hair] Richard, stop it! Stop it! Suddenly you're two years old.\nRICHARD: Oh, I'm just having fun.\nEMILY: I'm not complaining.\nRICHARD: This is fun too. This is like a roller coaster.\nEMILY: A little.\nRICHARD: Say, when was the last time we were on a roller coaster?\nEMILY: Never.\nRICHARD: Didn't we ever go to Coney Island?\nEMILY: That must've been your other wife.\nRICHARD: Gosh, I used to love it when I was a kid. They were a lot faster then too.\nEMILY: And less safe.\nRICHARD: We should go on one.\nEMILY: What?\nRICHARD: A fast one.\nEMILY: Fine. You go and I'll wait and hold your cotton candy for you.\nRICHARD: You are going.\nEMILY: It would take a whole day.\nRICHARD: You are going.\nEMILY: I'd be scared.\nRICHARD: I'll hold your hand.\nEMILY: Fine. We'll go on a roller coaster.\nRICHARD: Good.\nEMILY: Now where is this roller coaster we're going on?\nRICHARD: I'm not sure. I'll get Rory to look it up on the Internet for us.\n[cut to Rory getting in a sleigh]\nDRIVER: That it miss?\nRORY: I guess I'm alone.\n[The sleigh starts going. Jess jumps into the seat next to Rory]\nRORY: What are you doing?\nJESS: Well, I heard it was two to a sleigh - no more, no less. You were breaking the rules.\nRORY: You could've hurt yourself.\nJESS: I live on the edge. I can jump out if you want.\nRORY: Doesn't matter to me.\nJESS: Are you mad at me or something?\nRORY: What do you think?\nJESS: I can't read your mind.\nRORY: You got into a fight with Dean.\nJESS: Dean?\nRORY: My boyfriend.\nJESS: Ah. He's still your boyfriend?\nRORY: Okay, you can jump out now.\nJESS: I wasn't fighting him. I was fighting someone else. He jumped in on his own.\nRORY: He was trying to help you.\nJESS: Oh, he should go into government service if he's so interested in helping people. But me, he can stop worrying about.\nRORY: Why were you fighting in the first place?\nJESS: 'Cause Chuck Presby's a jerk.\nRORY: You were fighting Chuck Presby?\nJESS: Yeah.\nRORY: Oh, he is a jerk.\nJESS: This whole town is weird and full of jerks.\nRORY: Then why are you still here?\nJESS: What do you mean?\nRORY: I mean, school's out and you don't like it here, so why don't you just go home?\nJESS: My mom didn't want me to.\nRORY: I don't believe that.\nJESS: That's your right, I guess.\nRORY: Did Luke say she didn't want you to?\nJESS: Luke told me it was his idea that I should stay. It wasn't his idea. That's good.\nRORY: What?\nJESS: Your snowman. Snowwoman, actually.\nRORY: You know which one is ours?\nJESS: It definitely has the most personality. Kind of looks like Bjork.\nRORY: That's what we were going for.\nJESS: Yeah?\nRORY: But everyone thinks the one on the end is gonna be the winner.\nJESS: Really? It's so overdone.\nRORY: I agree.\nJESS: You should win.\nRORY: No argument.\nJESS: Hey, what do you and Dean talk about?\nRORY: What?\nJESS: I mean, does he know Bjork?\nRORY: I've played him some stuff.\nJESS: Hm. So you got a teacher-student thing going?\nRORY: Stop.\nJESS: No, really, I'm curious. What do you guys talk about?\nRORY: Everything.\nJESS: Like?\nRORY: Just everything, tons of stuff, whatever.\nJESS: It's just in the brief non-pugilistic time I've spent with him in class, he just doesn't seem like your kind of guy.\nRORY: Well, he is my kind of guy. He's exactly my kind of guy.\nJESS: Okay. I guess I don't know him that well.\nRORY: You don't. You don't.\nCUT TO INN DINING ROOM\n[All of the guests are seated at a long table. Lorelai stands at the head of the table with a camera.]\nLORELAI: Quiet please, everybody. Before the, uh, button popping and the bloating can commence, say cheese.\nEVERYONE: Cheese!\nLORELAI: Uh, now, ladies and gentlemen, damen und herren, um, the moment you've been waiting for, I give you the Bracebridge Dinner.\nSOOKIE: Whoa, whoa, hold it. We just need a quick minute, please.\nLORELAI: Which will be starting in one quick minute.\nBOOTSY: You ever think about that? You can't have a quick minute because it's always sixty seconds.\nLUKE: Shut up.\nMISS PATTY: Lorelai darling, who is the silver fox with the tight kneesocks?\nLORELAI: Oh, that's Claude. He's one of our regular servers, divorced and on the market.\nMISS PATTY: Oh, well the uniform is interesting.\nLORELAI: All right. I'll have him bathed, powdered, and sent to your room.\nMISS PATTY: What? Oh, you joke? Was that a joke?\nRICHARD: Lorelai, this is just beautiful. It's like something out of Architectural Digest. You should be very proud.\nLORELAI: Thanks Dad.\nEMILY: Your dress needs pressing.\nLORELAI: Thanks Mom.\n[Lorelai sits down next to Rory]\nLORELAI: Your pod Grandpa is still happy as a clam.\nRORY: See, I told you this would be good for him.\nLORELAI: When you're right, you're right.\nRUNE: Welcome Lords and Ladies. I call upon these sprightly horns to commence our proceedings. [horns play] Hey Chuck Mangione, you wanna back up a step?\nLORELAI: And we're off.\nRUNE: And now, fair people, I present my Lord and Master, the honorable Squire Bracebridge.\n[Jackson enters the room dressed as the Squire]\nJACKSON: Lo! Now has come our joyfullest feast. Let every man be jolly.\nJESS: We should've eaten before we came.\nLUKE: Shh! And yeah.\nJACKSON: Humble servant, bring us the first course to dine with pleasure. Mmm, methinks it be a butternut squash soup.\nRUNE: Ah, methinks you're right Squire Bracebridge, thus and verily.\nJACKSON: And verily thus.\nLORELAI: They're the Old England Abbot and Costello.\nJACKSON: 'Tis perfection, but extremely hot.\nRUNE: My Lord, do you need aid? Wouldst thou have thee ice thy tongue?\nJACKSON: Ah nay, Rune, nay. To the guests thou shall serve the soup!\nJESS: What's the white stuff?\nLUKE: I think it's cheese - or cream.\nJESS: And the green stuff?\nLUKE: I think it'sbest picked off.\nMRS. KIM: No one says grace?\nLANE: I think they all do Mama, uh, silently.\nMRS. KIM: Did you say silent grace?\nBABETTE: [laughs] Good one!\n[Mrs. Kim stares at her. Babette quickly bows her head and nudges for Morey to do the same. Cut to Kirk serving soup to Lorelai and Rory]\nKIRK: Soup for mi'ladies?\nRORY: Why thank you, kind sir.\nLORELAI: Hey Kirk, nice blouse.\nRORY: Don't let her make fun of you Kirk. You look great.\nKIRK: Soup with garlands, gay and rosemary.\nLORELAI: You're gonna stay in character no matter what, huh?\nKIRK: 'Tis hot, so proceed daintily.\nLORELAI: Hey, did you ever see that I Love Lucy where she goes to Buckingham Palace?\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: She tries to get the palace guard to break character. That was a funny one.\nKIRK: 'Tis foreign to me good lady.\nRORY: Hang in there, Kirk.\nLORELAI: Those ones where she was in Europe, hands down, those were the best!\nKIRK: No way, the Hollywood ones!\nLORELAI: Ha!\nKIRK: Damn!\nRORY: I was rooting for you boy.\n[Cut to later that evening]\nRUNE: My Lord, shall dessert be served?\nJACKSON: Anon, humble servant.\nCLARA: Can I eat my dessert with the horses?\nDEAN: Sure, uh, but put your coat on.\nCLARA: Are you okay?\nBOOTSY: I guess so. I've lost track of how many beers I've had.\nCLARA: Seven.\nLORELAI: Hey Paris, how's it going?\nPARIS: Fine, good, thanks for having me.\nLORELAI: Oh, it was our pleasure.\nPARIS: Did you notice the anachronisms?\nLORELAI: The what?\nPARIS: The period discrepancies. They were pretty blatant. I mean, forget that the nineteenth century didn't include recessed lighting or the Fossil watch that your server was wearing, but water in that period would not have been served with cubed ice.\nLORELAI: Right.\nPARIS: And your servers are wearing nylon blend shirts, and nylon was invented by a scientist at Dupont in the 1920's. It shattered the illusion.\nLORELAI: Floggings will be administered.\nRICHARD: So there we are, it's a beautiful moonlit Prague night, and we're strolling across the Charles Bridge when we come across this group of kids blasting this song by that. . .oh, that awful woman. Who is she? The tall bony one, married to the deceased mustachioed congressman.\nRORY: Cher?\nEMILY: That's the one!\nLORELAI: The year of 'Do you believe in life after love?'\nRORY: A difficult time for all of us.\nMICHEL: I like that song.\nRICHARD: Well, I was appalled. Prague has played host to some of the greatest composers in history. Mozart named a symphony after it, for heaven's sake. So what did I do?\nEMILY: I have tried so hard to forget this.\nRICHARD: I stood beside them and their boombox and I hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony as loud as I could. [starts humming]\nLORELAI: A bizarro Battle of the Bands.\nTAYLOR: And did it work?\nRICHARD: Well, they quickly packed up and went their way.\nEMILY: But then he kept on humming the Mozart. He wouldn't stop.\nRICHARD: Well, at that point I was hoping for some gullible tourists to drop money at my feet.\nEMILY: And two of them did.\nRICHARD: And I kept it!\nTAYLOR: You know, this might be the most interesting conversation I've ever had with an insurance man.\nRICHARD: Aww, I'm hurt.\nTAYLOR: I'm sorry Richard. What I meant was that\nRICHARD: No, what you meant was that people in the insurance industry are drones. Well I agree. They are a dull, dull lot, and I am glad to be rid of them.\nLORELAI: Rid of them?\nTAYLOR: Oh, are you retired Richard?\nRICHARD: Well, uh\nEMILY: Of course he's not. Richard? Richard?\nRICHARD: Actually, I am.\nCUT TO BEDROOM\n[Later that evening, Lorelai and Rory are in their room at the inn getting ready for bed.]\nLORELAI: Ah, it's always nice to end a big festive meal with a big festive pall hanging over the room.\nRORY: Most people didn't notice anything.\nLORELAI: I guess. Bootsy singing Hotel California accompanied by spoons drew people's attention away.\nRORY: Did Grandma and Grandpa say a word to each other the rest of the night?\nLORELAI: No.\nRORY: Why didn't he tell anyone?\nLORELAI: I'm sorry, are you asking me to interpret my parents' motives?\nRORY: My mistake. So which bed do you want?\nLORELAI: Take the one by the window.\nRORY: Okay. [pulls back blanket] Mom!\nLORELAI: What honey?\nRORY: You put the picture of the ugly baby in my bed?\nLORELAI: I didn't, I swear. That ugly baby is stalking us. Run away!\nRORY: Poor baby, it's not his fault.\nLORELAI: I think it's a she.\nRORY: Poor baby, you picked the wrong parents. Hey, have you heard from Dad recently?\nLORELAI: What dad - your dad?\nRORY: Yeah, my dad.\nLORELAI: Why?\nRORY: Because he's my dad, and he usually checks in this time of year and he hasn't checked in yet. I mean, I know he's probably busy with Sherry and the new apartment and...what?\nLORELAI: There may have been a call.\nRORY: There may have been? You don't remember?\nLORELAI: Well things have been so hectic, you know, with the Bracebridge Dinner, and um, building a snowwoman, and planning the ugly baby gag, that took time.\nRORY: Mom?\nLORELAI: Yes, he called! He called, he called, he called and invited you, and it's not too late to go. He called and invited you, so there you go. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, so there.\nRORY: He invited me over?\nLORELAI: Yes, are you deaf?\nRORY: No, I'm just trying to separate the gist from the ubububububah.\nLORELAI: Well, the gist is he invited you, okay?\nRORY: Why didn't he invite me himself?\nLORELAI: Because he's pretending to be considerate by running it past me first.\nRORY: Was he maybe not pretending to be considerate, and actually being considerate?\nLORELAI: Maybe. But I wouldn't put it past him to be inconsiderate. The guy doesn't have the greatest track record.\nRORY: Why didn't you tell me this? He's probably waiting for my answer, and holding off making plans.\nLORELAI: Because I have dibs on this time of year with you, not him! Me! And yes, he acknowledged that, and that was cool and all, but still - it stinks! Because he put me in a very difficult position because we were supposed to watch a lot of movies and make fun of Godfather 3, and the thing that I really, really hate about this isis the idea of you not hanging out with me because you're hanging out there with your stupid stepmother.\nRORY: You're calling Sherry my stepmother?\nLORELAI: Well, she practically is.\nRORY: You're wigging.\nLORELAI: There is something wrong with that woman.\nRORY: You don't even know her.\nLORELAI: You think I'm overreacting?\nRORY: I think you're jealous of Sherry.\nLORELAI: Ha, I'm not jealous of Sherry.\nRORY: But I understand - your territory has been threatened.\nLORELAI: Excuse me?\nRORY: But relax, there are ways to work through situations like this - compromises can be struck.\nLORELAI: Oh, what are you saying?\nRORY: Well, you know, I can still call you Mom, and I'll call her Mommy Sherry.\nLORELAI: Don't be mean.\nRORY: And we can split up holidays evenly. Like, I'll be with you on Labor Day\nLORELAI: Okay.\nRORY: her on Memorial Day.\nLORELAI: Enough.\nRORY: I'll have to find out about her religion though to see how Chanukah will factor into this, unless you want to convert to Judaism and then take over Chanukah for yourself.\nLORELAI: I get the point. I overreacted. Please stop.\nRORY: You totally overreacted. God.\nLORELAI: So do you think you're gonna go and stay with them?\nRORY: I'll have to think about it.\nLORELAI: Do you have to think about it because you know that it's killing me not to know whether you're going or not and you want to torture me like that?\nRORY: Nope, I just don't know if I want to do it.\nLORELAI: Oh.\nRORY: It was nice of him to ask though.\nLORELAI: It was very nice.\nRORY: 'Cause we are rooting for Dad.\nLORELAI: We are rooting for him. It was a very nice thing that Christopher offered. I was being a little possessive.\nRORY: And insanely jealous of his pretty girlfriend.\nLORELAI: Well, I wanna know if she's good enough for him.\nRORY: Me too.\nLORELAI: So there was an altruistic streak to my madness.\nRORY: We'll go with that.\n[there's a knock at the door. Lorelai answers, Emily is there.]\nEMILY: I need a new room.\nLORELAI: What?\nEMILY: I can't stay in that room.\nLORELAI: There are no other rooms, Mom.\nEMILY: Well, then I'll go home.\nRORY: Grandma, it's late.\nLORELAI: And pitch black, and the roads are icy. You can't be driving.\nEMILY: Well, I'm not going back to that room.\nLORELAI: I'm guessing you and Dad had it out about the job thing?\nEMILY: We haven't even spoken since dinner. I'm so upset, I wouldn't know where to begin. And I couldn't take being around him anymore. What he did is inexcusable. Not letting me know he left his job - as if it didn't affect me?\nLORELAI: Aw mom, try to calm down. Here, take this bed, and Rory and I will share.\nEMILY: I'm just a burden.\nLORELAI: You're not a burden, Mom.\nEMILY: Well, okay, thank you. Can I use the mirror in the bathroom for a second?\nLORELAI: Yes, I'll use the one out here.\n[Rory watches as Lorelai and Emily both apply cream to their face]\nRORY: Wow.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: Behold my future.\nEMILY: How do you turn out the light?\nLORELAI: I'll get it.\nEMILY: I still can't believe it.\nLORELAI: Try to relax Mom.\nEMILY: I hope he doesn't sleep because I surely won't.\nLORELAI: Oh, Mom.\nEMILY: These slippers you have here are hardly one size fits all. They're too big.\nLORELAI: Goodnight.\nEMILY: It was so irresponsible.\nLORELAI: Maybe he had no choice.\nEMILY: Of course he had a choice. Go to sleep Lorelai.\nLORELAI: That job was killing him, Mom. It was killing him.\nEMILY: I'm going for a little walk.\nRORY: Grandma, it's late.\nEMILY: I'm not tired.\nLORELAI: Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Gilmores of our lives.\nCUT TO LOBBY\n[Emily walks in and finds Richard sitting on the sofa]\nEMILY: I didn't know you were here.\nRICHARD: Emily, don't go.\nEMILY: I'm very tired.\nRICHARD: I want to talk to you, please. I don't need to remind you about how I've been feeling at work, and my frustration just built to the point whereagain, you know this. So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time with my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest. I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me, and I realized it was because I was smiling. Well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time. I was. . .I was happy.\nEMILY: And you chose not to tell me? Your own wife.\nRICHARD: Oh Emily, I know I've done nothing but disappoint you these past few months, what with how isolated I've become and all the social engagements I've made you cancel, and all the friendships I've jeopardized. And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options.

I gotta sneak back into my house. Oh, I'm so excited! [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah man. I remember the days of lying to my mother about a boy. Once I had a boy hidden in the closet and of course Mom wouldn't leave, so I finally had to pretend to get sick to my stomach just to get her out of the room long enough for him to climb out the window and down the tree. He fell, broke his leg. Ah, to be young again.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO AUCTION<\/p>\n<p>[A crowd is gathered in front of the gazebo filled with baskets.

So let me ask you something.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Napkin, please.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Who did you want to get your basket?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I mean, before you knew Patty was gonna put you on the Dating Game, you did pack this disgusting lunch and bring it out here, so who did you want to get it?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, last year Roy Wilkins bought it and I got my sprinklers fixed for half price.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Uh huh.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And this year my rain gutters are completely clogged, and I thought if I could get the Collins kid to bite, I'd get that taken care of.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Very practical.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I thought so.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: So the participation in this thing was purely for home improvement reasons?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes. And I don't know, it's a nice concept.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What is?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Just having someone who you love or have some kind of crazy crush on bid on your basket and then share a romantic lunch, it's a nice concept.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Well, I'm sure someday you'll manage to find the right guy and drag him out to this thing and make him by your stupid basket and then you'll be sitting out here with him.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, someday.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: You know what?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: This is nice.<\/p>\n<p>[Dean walks up behind them]<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I have to talk to you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, yeah, okay. I'll be right back.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: I'll be right here.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai walks out of the gazebo over to Dean]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, how're you doing?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Uh, I'm not great.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Aw, Dean, it's just a silly town thing.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I know, and I've been telling myself that and I tried to go home and forget about it, but I can't. I'm worried about Rory. I don't think she should be hanging out with this guy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I know that today was kind of a. . .<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: It's got nothing to do with today. I mean, yes, it has a little to do with today but it's more than that. Ever since I've met him, I've had this feeling that he was bad news.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, Jess has a few issues.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, one issue is that he's a complete jerk. I mean, he's always getting in fights at school. That is, when he bothers to show up at all. And he's just. . . I don't know. And now this whole thing with Rory, it's like he's always around.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You sound jealous.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I'm not jealous. He just. . . she has to be nice to everyone, you know?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know. But hon, that's Rory.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Well, he's gonna get her into trouble. I can feel it, I just know it. And he doesn't care about her, he's just using her to drive me crazy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Dean, you love Rory, right?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So, part of love is trust. You just have to trust her.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I do trust her, it's - .<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Him, I know. But flying off the handle like this is not gonna get you what you want. She cares about you, she's not gonna do anything to mess things up with you guys. I know this.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I hope you're right.<\/p>\n<p>[cut to Rory and Jess on the bridge]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Ten.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Ten?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah but I didn't understand a word of it, so I had to reread it when I was fifteen.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I've yet to make it through it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Really? Try it. The Fountainhead is classic.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Yeah, but Ayn Rand is a political nut.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, but nobody could write a forty page monologue the way that she could.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Okay, tomorrow I will try again, and you will. . .<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Give the painful Ernest Hemingway another chance. Yes, I promise.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: You know, Ernest only has lovely things to say about you.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why are you only nice to me?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Excuse me?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: An hour ago you were totally screwing with Dean and now you're totally nice to me.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: You see, it's the screwing with Dean - that's an important step to getting here so that I can be nice to you.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So it was a plan.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: What?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: The whole bidding on my basket, it was a plan.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Okay, I'm officially starving.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And officially evasive.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Come on, I'll get you a pizza.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Answer my question.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Do you like pepperoni?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Not going to, are you?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: We can just get it on half if you want.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, I give, let's go.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: If you insist.<\/p>\n<p>[Rory walks away, not realizing her bracelet had fallen off. Jess picks it up and puts it in his pocket.]<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai is sitting on the couch as Rory walks in the front door]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, hey. Where've you been? I thought Taylor auctioned you off to the highest bidder.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, I just went to get some pizza and I, uh, wandered around the bookstore for a little while. Here. [hands her a book]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What's this?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You said you wanted to read the Children's Hour.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I did?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: The other night when we were watching Julia, and Jane Fonda was playing Lillian Hellman.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh yeah, and I made the Hellmann's mayonnaise joke.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Which no one ever needs to hear again.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Right, right. Well, thanks.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're welcome.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So who were you with?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Pizza, book buying - did you have company?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Who?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Um, Jess.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Jess?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Right.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So, I'll be in my room.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, good.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai follows Rory into her room]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So how was the picnic?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Fine.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good. Did you get the Dean issue resolved?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Not yet. He's coming over later and we're gonna smooth things over hopefully.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Aw, yeah, well, smoothing's good. I love the smoothing. So, how was it with Jess?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Fine.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well obviously, the pizza and the books. So good, that's. . .I'm glad.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What what?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, you look like you have something to say.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I have nothing to say. I never have anything to say.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes, that is your reputation.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's. . .I don't know. I'm just surprised that you're hanging out with him, that's all.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: He doesn't seem like the nicest kid.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, you don't know him.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I guess not.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're just judging him by that one time that he came over here.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Which, by the way, was not a rousing success.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He had just moved here. He was mad at his mom. Trust me, he's got a really good side to him. You'll see it eventually.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good, I can't wait.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, well, I'm sorry. It's. . I just, uh, I don't know. From the things I've seen and the things I hear. . .<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Like what things?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: The vandalism, the stealing, the cutting school, the fighting.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: How do you know about the fighting?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, Dean told me.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Dean?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You've been discussing this with Dean?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, he discussed it with me.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: When?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Today. Rory, he's really upset about this.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So he went running to my mother?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, he needed someone to talk to.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, he could've talked to me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, he couldn't cause you were off with Jess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're taking his side?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm not taking sides here, okay? I'm Swiss, babe.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I wasn't off with Jess. I. . .Jess outbid him.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, the rule is that if one person outbids someone else, then. . .<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory, this is not about the rule. I know what the rule is. This is about Dean being concerned that you're hanging out with someone who can get you hurt.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: How could Jess get me hurt?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know, hon. In the short amount of time he's been here, he's managed to make a lot of enemies.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm sorry, when did I move to Salem?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: People are concerned about you, you know? You're young and na&iuml;ve and you think that everyone has some good inside if you give them a chance.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So you're saying that Jess is no good?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I've known guys like Jess. He seems cool because he's got this dangerous vibe and this problem with authority and he's seen a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh my God.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: But guys like this get into trouble which, if you hang out with them, gets you into trouble and I don't want you to get into trouble.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm sorry, are we talking about Dean still or are we suddenly talking about you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, I've been there, okay? You haven't.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Been where? I mean, we got pizza, we looked at some books. God, I can't even believe that I'm having this conversation with you. I mean, with you of all people. I mean. . . I don't even want to talk about this anymore.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, I'm going for a walk.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Uh, Dean is gonna be here any minute.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, he probably wants to talk to you anyhow.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: A cigar club. Can you imagine a more disgusting organization to join? Your grandfather now pays money to sit in an enclosed room with a bunch of other men and blow smoke in each other's faces. Twice a week he comes home smelling like a flophouse. So I finally just confronted him. I said, Richard, I know you're going through a transitional period here and I encourage your trying out new things, but this seems completely out of character for you.' I'm sorry, am I boring you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, you're not.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Sorry Grandma.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: So how are things at the inn?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Fine, the same.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And Rory, how's that boyfriend of yours?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Apparently very chatty.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well that's nice. Lorelai, anything new with you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet around the house lately.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, sometimes quiet can be nice. Soothing. You can hear yourself think. All right, what's going on with you too?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It's not nothing. You've both been sitting here all night, not saying a word and not even looking at each other. Are you in a fight?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm not.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Please.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Please what? You are the one who's been freezing me out all week.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I just haven't had anything to say. [her pager goes off]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Who is it?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No one.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Why won't you tell me who?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Cause it's no one.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Is it Jess?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're kidding, right?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Jess, who's Jess?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I'm not kidding.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why would you automatically assume that it's Jess?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Because why won't you tell me who it is?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Who's Jess?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Luke's nephew.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It's not Jess, okay? It's Dean. You wanna read it? Oh wait, no. Dean will probably tell you all about it later.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's not funny. You know, all week you've been - .<\/p>\n<p>RORY: We're not getting into this again.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What? Getting into what? Is it about this Jess the thing you're not getting into again?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You know, you never liked Dean at the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's because I didn't know him.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And now you don't like Jess?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's because I know him.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Are you dating Jess? What happened to Dean?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm not dating Jess.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, but he's trying to weasel his way in.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He's not trying to weasel his way.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: In where?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: In Rory's world. He has his eye on her, and he's trouble.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: He's not trouble.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes he is.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Rory, if your mother thinks this boy isn't appropriate company for you then you need to listen to her.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: There, thank you Mom.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Excuse me, but I don't feel very hungry right now.

KIM: Lane can't talk after nine.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mrs. Kim, I promise I will never again call Lane after nine, but can I please just talk to her now? Just this once?<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: Okay, just this once.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>[Mrs. Kim walks up to Lane's room]<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: Lane?<\/p>\n<p>LANE: What?<\/p>\n<p>MRS.

KIM: Come downstairs and have some tea.<\/p>\n<p>LANE: No, thank you.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: I know you're upset but I have these rules for a reason. I'm your mother, I know what's best for you.<\/p>\n<p>LANE: Can we talk about this tomorrow please?<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: You see, this is exactly why I make these rules. You're too young, too vulnerable. American boys have different values, they don't understand respect, you get hurt. I do all of this so you don't get hurt and now here you are hurt. I don't like this, I don't like this at all. Who is he, this boy who hurt you?<\/p>\n<p>LANE: Henry Cho.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: Cho?<\/p>\n<p>LANE: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: Cho sounds Korean.<\/p>\n<p>LANE: It is Korean.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: He was Korean?<\/p>\n<p>LANE: Yes, and he was smart and wonderful and cute.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: And and you're sure he was Korean?<\/p>\n<p>LANE: He's gonna be a doctor, he goes to church, he's a counselor at Bible camp, and he liked me.<\/p>\n<p>MRS. KIM: A doctor.<\/p>\n<p>LANE: I'm so stupid. I should've just told you and I didn't and now he's gone and I'm just stupid.<\/p>\n<p>MRS.

And I hate it because he's Luke's nephew and Rory likes him but. . .<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You are her mother Lorelai. You must set boundaries and restrictions, it's your job.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I wanted to like him but I just couldn't, and Rory can't see it.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, she's young.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And she won't take my word for it.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, she's young.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm overreacting.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Lorelai, listen to me. Now I don't say this to you very often, but on this matter I happen to agree with you one hundred percent.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Gee, thanks Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I know Rory's a good girl, but good girls can go bad with the wrong influences. We all know that.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh no no, I don't think Rory's actually gonna go bad.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Don't back down Lorelai. You took a stand and you are completely in the right here. You absolutely must keep her from that boy. If you need to change her curfew, lock her up, throw away the key, whatever it takes to make sure she doesn't go astray - you do it. Her judgment cannot be trusted here. She's a young girl and knows nothing. You are her eyes and her ears and her brain for as long as it takes to make sure she doesn't make any ridiculous choices in her life.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah.

No sighing, just let me talk.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Go ahead.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't wanna lock you up and throw away the key.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well good.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Your judgment means something, especially to me. I can't be your eyes and your ears and your brain.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm trying really hard to connect the dots here.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I got spooked. I know it violates the fabulous cool mom clause we're supposed to have going but I did and I'm sorry.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It's okay.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Now, I am concerned about Jess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, you shouldn't be.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: But I am. However, you are a smart girl, you're a good judge of character, and the fact that he seems to like you gives him a couple of brownie points. You're not a little kid. I don't actually think you ever were a little kid.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I was, for about a month.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: If you think he's a decent guy, I have to respect your judgment.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: But I'm asking you to be careful.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I will.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Really careful.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I will.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Boy in the plastic bubble' kind of careful.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I promise.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And you have to cut Dean some slack. He's so crazy about you. He didn't mean anything by coming to me. He just wigged.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So, fight over?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Fight over.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You still don't look okay.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, well, my mother agreed with me tonight.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm so sorry.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thank you, I appreciate that.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I need a shower.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Don't be so dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I agree with you a hundred percent.'

The women get to make a nice lunch basket, the men get to bid on it, and the world rotates backwards on its axis.\nRORY: I think it's fun.\nLORELAI: That's because you have a pretty boy to bid on your basket.\nRORY: Yes I do.\nLORELAI: Did you tell him to eat lunch first?\nRORY: Hi, I love him, of course. Hey, I'm gonna look in the back.\nLORELAI: All right, I'll hit the front. [walks up front] Hey Patty.

Why do you have a picture of me in your wallet?\nMISS PATTY: Oh, uh, well, it's a very nice picture.\nLORELAI: Thank you. Why do you have a very nice picture of me in your wallet?\nMISS PATTY: I'm a stalker?\nLORELAI: Or?\nMISS PATTY: Or when, in my daily travels, I run across a nice single guy...\nLORELAI: Oh God!\nMISS PATTY: I like to have a visual aid to help me with the wonderful buildup I give you.\nLORELAI: Patty, I appreciate the gesture but I don't need you to try to set me up.\nMISS PATTY: You're such a beautiful girl and you deserve a nice guy.\nLORELAI: I'll have a nice guy, but let me find him, okay?\nMISS PATTY: But you're no good at finding him.\nLORELAI: Patty.\nMISS PATTY: Oh, all right.\nLORELAI: Thank you. I'll keep this if you don't mind.\nMISS PATTY: Stubborn girl.\n[cut to Rory in the back looking at baskets.

As you were. [walks away]\nDEAN: I really hate that guy.\nRORY: He didn't do anything.\nDEAN: He's here, he's breathing, that's enough.\nRORY: I really wish you two could start over.\nDEAN: Why?\nRORY: Because he lives here and we run into him. He goes to school here. I just think it'd be easier.\nDEAN: I'm fine with the whole hating him thing, thank you.\nRORY: I just think it's a waste of energy.\nDEAN: You know, I'll have a PowerBar.\nRORY: Fine, forget it.\nDEAN: So, uh, I should probably get back to work. We still on for tonight?\nRORY: I don't know. I might be baking.\nDEAN: I'll pick you up at seven.

I'm sorry, now why am I doing this?\nSOOKIE: Because I'm baking for the picnic tomorrow and it's supposed to be a surprise.\nJACKSON: Oh sure, never see a pie before an auction, it's bad luck.\nLORELAI: Okay, uh, you guys talk, I have to go call Patty and stop the forced mating process.

About what?\nJACKSON: About re-upping my lease.\nSOOKIE: Mm hmm.\nJACKSON: So what do you think?\nSOOKIE: About re-upping your lease?\nJACKSON: Yes.\nSOOKIE: Well, you have a very nice kitchen.\nJACKSON: Yes, I know.\nSOOKIE: And I like your living room. Though that house across the street has sort of that creepy Miami Beach blue, which means that during the day you really can't look out your window, but at night it's not so bad.\nJACKSON: Sookie, forget about the house across the street.\nSOOKIE: Well, if you forget about the house across the street, I don't see why you shouldn't.\nJACKSON: You don't?\nSOOKIE: Nope.\nJACKSON: Oh, okay, fine. Um, I just wanted to check with you first.\nSOOKIE: Oh, I appreciate that.\nJACKSON: So, um, I guess I'll go re-up my lease then.\nSOOKIE: Sounds good.\nJACKSON: Yeah. Sounds good.\nCUT TO SIDEWALK\n[The day of the fundraiser, Lorelai and Rory walk down the street with their baskets]\nLORELAI: You know what's wonderful about this festival?\nRORY: No, what?\nLORELAI: That it always falls on the day after trash day. Therefore, all the stuff that you forgot to throw out that you would normally be stuck with for another whole week, you can instead put in a pretty basket and auction off for charity.\nRORY: That is wonderful.\n[Lane runs up behind them]\nLANE: Okay, I've got it all worked out.\nRORY: Tell please.\nLANE: Well, I invited my cousin David to come and bid on my basket, you know, to keep my mother happy.\nLORELAI: Uh huh.\nLANE: Then when he gets it, we tell my mom we're gonna go eat over at the park where Henry's gonna call on the pay phone at exactly two o'clock for the all is clear' sigh. Then David, with the twenty bucks I give him, will disappear, Henry will arrive, and we'll finally have out first official date.\nLORELAI: My head is spinning.\nLANE: Stash this at Miss Patty's for me, okay?\nRORY: Don't you need this for David to bid on?\nLANE: Oh no, my mom packed that one. You know, homemade granola, wheat grass juice, soy chicken taco.\nLORELAI: Suddenly our lunches are looking pretty good.\nLANE: This is the Henry basket. I went by Gianelli's and stopped in and picked up a couple of meatball heroes and some chips. I also packed a change of clothes, makeup, makeup remover, and three temporary tattoos.\nLORELAI: Sure, cause four would be trashy.\nLANE: I gotta go. I gotta sneak back into my house. Oh, I'm so excited! [leaves]\nLORELAI: Ah man. I remember the days of lying to my mother about a boy. Once I had a boy hidden in the closet and of course Mom wouldn't leave, so I finally had to pretend to get sick to my stomach just to get her out of the room long enough for him to climb out the window and down the tree. He fell, broke his leg. Ah, to be young again.\nCUT TO AUCTION\n[A crowd is gathered in front of the gazebo filled with baskets.

My mother and I have been doing this every year since we moved here.\nDEAN: So buck tradition.\nRORY: Are you kidding? Do you remember how mad Taylor was when I was sick and I couldn't go to the turkey-calling contest?\nDEAN: This isn't school, you're not getting graded.\nRORY: Just don't make this into a big thing.\nDEAN: Don't go.\nJESS: Oh geez man, she's not shipping off to Nam.\nDEAN: You SO need to shut up now.\nRORY: Look, Dean, it's a picnic, it's lunch.

I've never been out with you.\nLANE: Well yeah, but that's what today was supposed to be, a date.\nHENRY: A date where we need a secret plan and a two-honk driveby and a decoy cousin?\nLANE: Well, yeah.\nHENRY: Lane, I like you but I want to be able to actually pick you up, stop the car, and take you out. And I wanna be able to call you, at your house.\nLANE: I'm gonna tell my mother, I promise.\nHENRY: When?\nLANE: Soon.\nHENRY: Yeah. Look, I've got prom coming up and my friends and I are gonna rent a limo to take us there and I wanna go, and I wanna take a date.\nLANE: Well, I'm sure I can figure something out. Maybe Rory can .\nHENRY: I asked somebody else.\nLANE: Oh.\nHENRY: I'm sorry, I just figured you'd never be able to go and - .\nLANE: No, it's okay, that's good. You should've asked someone else.\nHENRY: I do like you Lane.\nLANE: Okay, well, thank you, I appreciate that. I have to go.\nHENRY: Lane.\nCUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES\n[Lane walks up to the house as Mrs. Kim walks out.]\nMRS. KIM: David came by here fifteen minutes ago, said you ran off somewhere! Where did you run?\nLANE: Nowhere.\nMRS. KIM: Who is he?\nLANE: Who?\nMRS. KIM: The boy you ran off to see! The one who calls here pretending to work for the Wall Street Journal!\nLANE: There's no boy.\nMRS. KIM: You know the rules, no boys! Not unless I approve and I don't approve!\nLANE: How do you know?\nMRS. KIM: I know, I know! You're sneaking, you're lying, that means something's wrong with this boy!\nLANE: There's nothing wrong with this boy. He's perfect and he likes me and I was so afraid to tell you about him that now he's gonna take somebody else to the prom and I blew it!\nMRS. KIM: You go upstairs right now and calm down!\nLANE: Fine!\nMRS. KIM: Now!\nLANE: Fine! [stomps up the stairs]\nMRS. KIM: That is not calming down!\n[cut to Rory and Jess walks towards the bridge]\nJESS: Where do you wanna eat?\nRORY: Don't care.\nJESS: Okay.\nRORY: Where are you going?\nJESS: Thought you didn't care.\nRORY: I'm not jumping in the lake.\nJESS: No underwater dining, got it.\nRORY: Now what?\nJESS: Now we sit.\nRORY: Here?\nJESS: Yup.\nRORY: On the bridge, that's where we're gonna eat?\nJESS: Yup.\nRORY: Okay.\nJESS: Yeah, I like this place.\nRORY: Wow. A place in Stars Hollow you actually like. I'm stunned.\nJESS: It's got some good memories. You see right over there?\nRORY: Yup.\nJESS: That's where Luke pushed me in.\nRORY: Huh.\nJESS: Yeah.\nRORY: It's nice.\nJESS: It is.\nRORY: So why'd you do it?\nJESS: Do what?\nRORY: Outbid Dean like that.\nJESS: I don't know. I guess it started as a joke just to bug him, but then he just got so mad, you know? And he is so tall, and I just was looking at him and he's standing there all tall and mad and I just. . .I don't know. It was. . .it was really funny.\nRORY: It wasn't funny.\nJESS: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't intend to do it. Does that make you feel any better?\nRORY: I just don't wanna be in a fight with Dean.\nJESS: I'm sorry about that. You wanna push me in the lake? It's cathartic, I hear.\nRORY: Hm, maybe in a little.\nJESS: Whatever. So why don't we open this thing?\nRORY: Go ahead.\n[Jess opens the picnic basket]\nJESS: Wow. Not one thing in here that I would remotely consider eating.\nRORY: Well, I didn't make it for you. I made it for Dean.\nJESS: And Dean would've eaten this? [holds up a container]\nRORY: Yes, he would have.\n[Jess tastes a forkful of the food and makes a face]\nJESS: Dean is an idiot.\nRORY: Dean never would've fallen for that.\nJESS: Ah, ha ha.\n[cut to Jackson and Sookie sitting on a blanket]\nSOOKIE: I can't believe he wouldn't take your check.\nJACKSON: Well, apparently, I don't look like my picture.\nSOOKIE: He's a loon.\nJACKSON: Yeah. It's okay. I'm paying him off in weekly installment in crinkle cut carrot sticks.\nSOOKIE: I'm glad we made up.\nJACKSON: Yeah, me too.\nSOOKIE: And you know, if you still wanted to talk about, you know, what we were talking about, we could talk about it now.\nJACKSON: Hmm, nah.\nSOOKIE: Excuse me?\nJACKSON: I don't know. I'm having second thoughts.\nSOOKIE: You are?\nJACKSON: Yeah. I mean, living together - big deal, right?\nSOOKIE: Oh right. Big deal. Who cares? Not me. No siree, Bob. So, I'm sorry, you don't think we should live together anymore?\nJACKSON: Nope.\nSOOKIE: Okay.\nJACKSON: I think we should get married.\nSOOKIE: What?\nJACKSON: I think we should get married.\nSOOKIE: But uh, but. . .\nJACKSON: Soon.\nSOOKIE: Are you pregnant?\nJACKSON: What do you say? Sookie?\nSOOKIE: Yes! I say yes. Oh my God, we're getting married! You do know that this means we'll have to live together, right?\nJACKSON: Yes I do.\nSOOKIE: Okay, good.\n[Cut to Luke and Lorelai sitting in the gazebo]\nLORELAI: You know, your burgers actually taste better outside.\nLUKE: Good. Next time the roof in the diner's leaking, I'll just rip the stupid thing off.\nLORELAI: So this is nice, huh? Come on, admit it.\nLUKE: Never.\nLORELAI: What? Admit it, you would much rather be sitting out here than inside working.\nLUKE: The diner's probably on fire by now.\nLORELAI: You are stubborn.\nLUKE: I'm stubborn?\nLORELAI: Yeah, you're stubborn.\nLUKE: You're Miss Flexibility over here?\nLORELAI: Hey, I can be flexible.\nLUKE: Please.\nLORELAI: I can. As long as everything is exactly the way I want it, I'm totally flexible.\nLUKE: Ah, well, my mistake.\nLORELAI: Do you want a fry?\nLUKE: You want a carrot?\nLORELAI: Impossible.\nLUKE: Right back at ya. So let me ask you something.\nLORELAI: Napkin, please.\nLUKE: Who did you want to get your basket?\nLORELAI: What?\nLUKE: I mean, before you knew Patty was gonna put you on the Dating Game, you did pack this disgusting lunch and bring it out here, so who did you want to get it?\nLORELAI: Well, last year Roy Wilkins bought it and I got my sprinklers fixed for half price.\nLUKE: Uh huh.\nLORELAI: And this year my rain gutters are completely clogged, and I thought if I could get the Collins kid to bite, I'd get that taken care of.\nLUKE: Very practical.\nLORELAI: I thought so.\nLUKE: So the participation in this thing was purely for home improvement reasons?\nLORELAI: Yes. And I don't know, it's a nice concept.\nLUKE: What is?\nLORELAI: Just having someone who you love or have some kind of crazy crush on bid on your basket and then share a romantic lunch, it's a nice concept.\nLUKE: Well, I'm sure someday you'll manage to find the right guy and drag him out to this thing and make him by your stupid basket and then you'll be sitting out here with him.\nLORELAI: Yeah, someday.\nLUKE: You know what?\nLORELAI: What?\nLUKE: This is nice.\n[Dean walks up behind them]\nDEAN: I have to talk to you.\nLORELAI: Oh, yeah, okay. I'll be right back.\nLUKE: I'll be right here.\n[Lorelai walks out of the gazebo over to Dean]\nLORELAI: Hey, how're you doing?\nDEAN: Uh, I'm not great.\nLORELAI: Aw, Dean, it's just a silly town thing.\nDEAN: I know, and I've been telling myself that and I tried to go home and forget about it, but I can't. I'm worried about Rory. I don't think she should be hanging out with this guy.\nLORELAI: Well, I know that today was kind of a. . .\nDEAN: It's got nothing to do with today. I mean, yes, it has a little to do with today but it's more than that. Ever since I've met him, I've had this feeling that he was bad news.\nLORELAI: Yes, Jess has a few issues.\nDEAN: Yeah, one issue is that he's a complete jerk. I mean, he's always getting in fights at school. That is, when he bothers to show up at all. And he's just. . . I don't know. And now this whole thing with Rory, it's like he's always around.\nLORELAI: You sound jealous.\nDEAN: I'm not jealous. He just. . . she has to be nice to everyone, you know?\nLORELAI: I know. But hon, that's Rory.\nDEAN: Well, he's gonna get her into trouble. I can feel it, I just know it. And he doesn't care about her, he's just using her to drive me crazy.\nLORELAI: Dean, you love Rory, right?\nDEAN: Yeah.\nLORELAI: So, part of love is trust. You just have to trust her.\nDEAN: I do trust her, it's - .\nLORELAI: Him, I know. But flying off the handle like this is not gonna get you what you want. She cares about you, she's not gonna do anything to mess things up with you guys. I know this.\nDEAN: I hope you're right.\n[cut to Rory and Jess on the bridge]\nRORY: Ten.\nJESS: Ten?\nRORY: Yeah but I didn't understand a word of it, so I had to reread it when I was fifteen.\nJESS: I've yet to make it through it.\nRORY: Really? Try it. The Fountainhead is classic.\nJESS: Yeah, but Ayn Rand is a political nut.\nRORY: Yeah, but nobody could write a forty page monologue the way that she could.\nJESS: Okay, tomorrow I will try again, and you will. . .\nRORY: Give the painful Ernest Hemingway another chance. Yes, I promise.\nJESS: You know, Ernest only has lovely things to say about you.\nRORY: Why are you only nice to me?\nJESS: Excuse me?\nRORY: An hour ago you were totally screwing with Dean and now you're totally nice to me.\nJESS: You see, it's the screwing with Dean - that's an important step to getting here so that I can be nice to you.\nRORY: So it was a plan.\nJESS: What?\nRORY: The whole bidding on my basket, it was a plan.\nJESS: Okay, I'm officially starving.\nRORY: And officially evasive.\nJESS: Come on, I'll get you a pizza.\nRORY: Answer my question.\nJESS: Do you like pepperoni?\nRORY: Not going to, are you?\nJESS: We can just get it on half if you want.\nRORY: Okay, I give, let's go.\nJESS: If you insist.\n[Rory walks away, not realizing her bracelet had fallen off. Jess picks it up and puts it in his pocket.]\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai is sitting on the couch as Rory walks in the front door]\nRORY: Mom?\nLORELAI: Oh, hey. Where've you been? I thought Taylor auctioned you off to the highest bidder.\nRORY: No, I just went to get some pizza and I, uh, wandered around the bookstore for a little while. Here. [hands her a book]\nLORELAI: What's this?\nRORY: You said you wanted to read the Children's Hour.\nLORELAI: I did?\nRORY: The other night when we were watching Julia, and Jane Fonda was playing Lillian Hellman.\nLORELAI: Oh yeah, and I made the Hellmann's mayonnaise joke.\nRORY: Which no one ever needs to hear again.\nLORELAI: Right, right. Well, thanks.\nRORY: You're welcome.\nLORELAI: So who were you with?\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: Pizza, book buying - did you have company?\nRORY: Oh, yeah.\nLORELAI: Who?\nRORY: Um, Jess.\nLORELAI: Jess?\nRORY: Yeah.\nLORELAI: Right.\nRORY: So, I'll be in my room.\nLORELAI: Okay, good.\n[Lorelai follows Rory into her room]\nLORELAI: So how was the picnic?\nRORY: Fine.\nLORELAI: Good. Did you get the Dean issue resolved?\nRORY: Not yet. He's coming over later and we're gonna smooth things over hopefully.\nLORELAI: Aw, yeah, well, smoothing's good. I love the smoothing. So, how was it with Jess?\nRORY: Fine.\nLORELAI: Well obviously, the pizza and the books. So good, that's. . .I'm glad.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: What what?\nRORY: Well, you look like you have something to say.\nLORELAI: I have nothing to say. I never have anything to say.\nRORY: Yes, that is your reputation.\nLORELAI: It's. . .I don't know. I'm just surprised that you're hanging out with him, that's all.\nRORY: Why?\nLORELAI: He doesn't seem like the nicest kid.\nRORY: Well, you don't know him.\nLORELAI: No, I guess not.\nRORY: You're just judging him by that one time that he came over here.\nLORELAI: Which, by the way, was not a rousing success.\nRORY: He had just moved here. He was mad at his mom. Trust me, he's got a really good side to him. You'll see it eventually.\nLORELAI: Good, I can't wait.\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: No, well, I'm sorry. It's. . I just, uh, I don't know. From the things I've seen and the things I hear. . .\nRORY: Like what things?\nLORELAI: The vandalism, the stealing, the cutting school, the fighting.\nRORY: How do you know about the fighting?\nLORELAI: Well, Dean told me.\nRORY: Dean?\nLORELAI: Yes.\nRORY: You've been discussing this with Dean?\nLORELAI: No, he discussed it with me.\nRORY: When?\nLORELAI: Today. Rory, he's really upset about this.\nRORY: So he went running to my mother?\nLORELAI: Well, he needed someone to talk to.\nRORY: Well, he could've talked to me.\nLORELAI: No, he couldn't cause you were off with Jess.\nRORY: You're taking his side?\nLORELAI: I'm not taking sides here, okay? I'm Swiss, babe.\nRORY: I wasn't off with Jess. I. . .Jess outbid him.\nLORELAI: I know.\nRORY: Well, the rule is that if one person outbids someone else, then. . .\nLORELAI: Rory, this is not about the rule. I know what the rule is. This is about Dean being concerned that you're hanging out with someone who can get you hurt.\nRORY: How could Jess get me hurt?\nLORELAI: I don't know, hon. In the short amount of time he's been here, he's managed to make a lot of enemies.\nRORY: I'm sorry, when did I move to Salem?\nLORELAI: People are concerned about you, you know? You're young and naïve and you think that everyone has some good inside if you give them a chance.\nRORY: So you're saying that Jess is no good?\nLORELAI: I've known guys like Jess. He seems cool because he's got this dangerous vibe and this problem with authority and he's seen a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies.\nRORY: Oh my God.\nLORELAI: But guys like this get into trouble which, if you hang out with them, gets you into trouble and I don't want you to get into trouble.\nRORY: I'm sorry, are we talking about Dean still or are we suddenly talking about you?\nLORELAI: Hey, I've been there, okay? You haven't.\nRORY: Been where? I mean, we got pizza, we looked at some books. God, I can't even believe that I'm having this conversation with you. I mean, with you of all people. I mean. . . I don't even want to talk about this anymore.\nLORELAI: Rory.\nRORY: No, I'm going for a walk.\nLORELAI: Uh, Dean is gonna be here any minute.\nRORY: Well, he probably wants to talk to you anyhow.\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner.]\nEMILY: A cigar club. Can you imagine a more disgusting organization to join? Your grandfather now pays money to sit in an enclosed room with a bunch of other men and blow smoke in each other's faces. Twice a week he comes home smelling like a flophouse. So I finally just confronted him. I said, Richard, I know you're going through a transitional period here and I encourage your trying out new things, but this seems completely out of character for you.' I'm sorry, am I boring you?\nLORELAI: No, you're not.\nRORY: Sorry Grandma.\nEMILY: So how are things at the inn?\nLORELAI: Fine, the same.\nEMILY: And Rory, how's that boyfriend of yours?\nRORY: Apparently very chatty.\nEMILY: Well that's nice. Lorelai, anything new with you?\nLORELAI: No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet around the house lately.\nEMILY: Well, sometimes quiet can be nice. Soothing. You can hear yourself think. All right, what's going on with you too?\nLORELAI: Nothing.\nEMILY: It's not nothing. You've both been sitting here all night, not saying a word and not even looking at each other. Are you in a fight?\nLORELAI: I'm not.\nRORY: Please.\nLORELAI: Please what? You are the one who's been freezing me out all week.\nRORY: I just haven't had anything to say. [her pager goes off]\nLORELAI: Who is it?\nRORY: No one.\nLORELAI: Why won't you tell me who?\nRORY: Cause it's no one.\nLORELAI: Is it Jess?\nRORY: You're kidding, right?\nEMILY: Jess, who's Jess?\nLORELAI: No, I'm not kidding.\nRORY: Why would you automatically assume that it's Jess?\nLORELAI: Because why won't you tell me who it is?\nEMILY: Who's Jess?\nLORELAI: Luke's nephew.\nRORY: It's not Jess, okay? It's Dean. You wanna read it? Oh wait, no. Dean will probably tell you all about it later.\nLORELAI: That's not funny. You know, all week you've been - .\nRORY: We're not getting into this again.\nEMILY: What? Getting into what? Is it about this Jess the thing you're not getting into again?\nRORY: You know, you never liked Dean at the beginning.\nLORELAI: That's because I didn't know him.\nRORY: And now you don't like Jess?\nLORELAI: That's because I know him.\nEMILY: Are you dating Jess? What happened to Dean?\nRORY: I'm not dating Jess.\nLORELAI: No, but he's trying to weasel his way in.\nRORY: He's not trying to weasel his way.\nEMILY: In where?\nLORELAI: In Rory's world. He has his eye on her, and he's trouble.\nRORY: He's not trouble.\nLORELAI: Yes he is.\nEMILY: Rory, if your mother thinks this boy isn't appropriate company for you then you need to listen to her.\nLORELAI: There, thank you Mom.\nRORY: Excuse me, but I don't feel very hungry right now. [leaves table]\nCUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY\n[Rory walks in and shuts the door. She sits down, then walks over to the phone and dials]\nMRS. KIM: Kim's Antiques, we're closed, call tomorrow.\nRORY: Mrs. Kim, it's Rory.\nMRS. KIM: It's after nine.\nRORY: I know.\nMRS. KIM: Lane can't talk after nine.\nRORY: Mrs. Kim, I promise I will never again call Lane after nine, but can I please just talk to her now? Just this once?\nMRS. KIM: Okay, just this once.\nRORY: Thank you.\n[Mrs. Kim walks up to Lane's room]\nMRS. KIM: Lane?\nLANE: What?\nMRS. KIM: Phone.\nLANE: But it's after nine.\nMRS. KIM: It's okay, it's Rory.\nLANE: I don't want to talk right now.\nMRS. KIM: Rory?\nRORY: Yes?\nMRS. KIM: Lane's not feeling well, she needs to call you tomorrow.\nRORY: Oh, okay. Um, thanks anyhow.\nMRS. KIM: Yes, goodbye. [hangs up] Lane!\n[she walks into Lane's room]\nMRS. KIM: It's early for you to be in bed.\nLANE: I'm tired.\nMRS. KIM: Come downstairs and have some tea.\nLANE: No, thank you.\nMRS. KIM: I know you're upset but I have these rules for a reason. I'm your mother, I know what's best for you.\nLANE: Can we talk about this tomorrow please?\nMRS. KIM: You see, this is exactly why I make these rules. You're too young, too vulnerable. American boys have different values, they don't understand respect, you get hurt. I do all of this so you don't get hurt and now here you are hurt. I don't like this, I don't like this at all. Who is he, this boy who hurt you?\nLANE: Henry Cho.\nMRS. KIM: Cho?\nLANE: Yes.\nMRS. KIM: Cho sounds Korean.\nLANE: It is Korean.\nMRS. KIM: He was Korean?\nLANE: Yes, and he was smart and wonderful and cute.\nMRS. KIM: And and you're sure he was Korean?\nLANE: He's gonna be a doctor, he goes to church, he's a counselor at Bible camp, and he liked me.\nMRS. KIM: A doctor.\nLANE: I'm so stupid. I should've just told you and I didn't and now he's gone and I'm just stupid.\nMRS. KIM: Maybe I can call his mother.\nLANE: I don't want to talk about this anymore.\nMRS. KIM: You're sure he was Korean?\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Lorelai and Emily sit at the table]\nLORELAI: I swear Mom, there's just something about that kid that. . .ugh, I don't know. And I hate it because he's Luke's nephew and Rory likes him but. . .\nEMILY: You are her mother Lorelai. You must set boundaries and restrictions, it's your job.\nLORELAI: I wanted to like him but I just couldn't, and Rory can't see it.\nEMILY: Well, she's young.\nLORELAI: And she won't take my word for it.\nEMILY: Well, she's young.\nLORELAI: I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm overreacting.\nEMILY: Lorelai, listen to me. Now I don't say this to you very often, but on this matter I happen to agree with you one hundred percent.\nLORELAI: Gee, thanks Mom.\nEMILY: I know Rory's a good girl, but good girls can go bad with the wrong influences. We all know that.\nLORELAI: Oh no no, I don't think Rory's actually gonna go bad.\nEMILY: Don't back down Lorelai. You took a stand and you are completely in the right here. You absolutely must keep her from that boy. If you need to change her curfew, lock her up, throw away the key, whatever it takes to make sure she doesn't go astray - you do it. Her judgment cannot be trusted here. She's a young girl and knows nothing. You are her eyes and her ears and her brain for as long as it takes to make sure she doesn't make any ridiculous choices in her life.\nLORELAI: Yeah. Would you excuse me for a sec?\nCUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY\n[Lorelai pushes open the door]\nLORELAI: Hey, can I come in?\nRORY: It's not my house, I can't stop you.\nLORELAI: Just listen to me for one second okay? No sighing, just let me talk.\nRORY: Go ahead.\nLORELAI: I don't wanna lock you up and throw away the key.\nRORY: Well good.\nLORELAI: Your judgment means something, especially to me. I can't be your eyes and your ears and your brain.\nRORY: I'm trying really hard to connect the dots here.\nLORELAI: I got spooked. I know it violates the fabulous cool mom clause we're supposed to have going but I did and I'm sorry.\nRORY: It's okay.\nLORELAI: Now, I am concerned about Jess.\nRORY: Well, you shouldn't be.\nLORELAI: But I am. However, you are a smart girl, you're a good judge of character, and the fact that he seems to like you gives him a couple of brownie points. You're not a little kid. I don't actually think you ever were a little kid.\nRORY: I was, for about a month.\nLORELAI: If you think he's a decent guy, I have to respect your judgment.\nRORY: Thank you.\nLORELAI: But I'm asking you to be careful.\nRORY: I will.\nLORELAI: Really careful.\nRORY: I will.\nLORELAI: Boy in the plastic bubble' kind of careful.\nRORY: I promise.\nLORELAI: And you have to cut Dean some slack. He's so crazy about you. He didn't mean anything by coming to me. He just wigged.\nRORY: I know.\nLORELAI: So, fight over?\nRORY: Fight over.\nLORELAI: Good.\nRORY: You still don't look okay.\nLORELAI: Oh, well, my mother agreed with me tonight.\nRORY: I'm so sorry.\nLORELAI: Thank you, I appreciate that.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door.]\nLORELAI: I need a shower.\nRORY: Don't be so dramatic.\nLORELAI: I agree with you a hundred percent.' Ugh!\nRORY: Go upstairs.\nLORELAI: Find a movie, I'll be down in a minute.\nRORY: Okay.\nLORELAI: I agree with you a hundred percent.'

You might wanna put your hand over that. There we go. [walks over to construction worker] Tom, what the hell is going on up there?<\/p>\n<p>TOM: We're redoing your apartment. What do you think is going on up there?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: The ceiling's falling in. I've got customers eating drywall here.<\/p>\n<p>TOM: Oh, well, that can't be good.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: You said minimal disruptions.<\/p>\n<p>TOM: Hey, this is minimal disruptions. Look, I need you to sign this change order.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What happened now?<\/p>\n<p>TOM: Well, we broke through this wall and we found some pipes that shouldn't be there. We gotta move them.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Move them where?<\/p>\n<p>TOM: Not sure. We gotta find out what they do first.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: You're kidding?<\/p>\n<p>TOM: Oh yeah. There's nothing I like more than a good moving a pipe' joke.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Fine, one more week, that's it.<\/p>\n<p>TOM: Oh, sure, construction ultimatum. Ha, that's even funnier than my moving pipe joke.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Rory walk in]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Hey.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Geez, look at this place.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It's a mess.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: How long .<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Nope can't sit here.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Why not?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Three people got nailed in the head here earlier.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: But their food was okay, right?<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Will you just move? [Lorelai's cell phone rings] Outside.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You know, if I sit here one more second, I just might be outside. Order me some coffee.<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai walks away; Jess walks over to the table and hands Rory an open umbrella]<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Oh, you are really funny. You and Tom should put an act together. I'd leave it open.<\/p>\n<p>[cut to outside]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Go ahead Mom, I can hear you now.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I wanted to know if you'd like a gift certificate for a weekend at the Birch Grove Spa.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Are you serious?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I bid on it at the DAR Symphony Fundraiser and I won.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Birch Grove? That's supposed to be an amazing place, why don't you go?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, I've never had any real desire to go to a spa.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Why'd you bid on it then?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It was for charity, I had to bid on something. And I certainly didn't want another portrait of George Washington. I've got four in the attic already.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I'd love it.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Good.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Two days of total mind-numbing pampering. Massages, facials, aromatherapy.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: My goodness, you make it sound like heaven.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's as close as you'll ever come to being a dog.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I beg your pardon?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You know, a whole life of nothing but eating, sleeping, lying on your back and getting rubbed.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'd love the comparison to stop there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Deal. Um, hey, when's it for?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: This weekend, actually.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, well, I'll be there.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: So will I.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Excuse me?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, the certificate is for two, and since you make it sound like the most wonderful place in the world, I might as well try it with you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, but - .<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That's all right, isn't it, if I join you? You don't mind?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I don't mind at all.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Wonderful. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

Uh, great. Thanks so much for your help. Okay, bye. [hangs up] Yeeessss!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That was an evil yes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Not an evil yes. It's a yes, I'm pretty, but hello, I'm smart' kind of a yes.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, my mistake.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So here's the deal I go into my facial just as my mother is finishing her salt glow, which will end ten minutes after I've hit my scalp treatment which puts me in the watsu massage pool at least six minutes into her back facial. Uh, in fact, the day is so well planned, I won't see her until dinner which will be cut tragically short by the food poisoning I plan to contract.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You are twelve and disgusting.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I am trapped and desperate.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You really think you can avoid Grandma the entire weekend?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, I'm nothing if not a great organizer. Now, let's talk about what you're gonna do tonight. Throwing a party, I hope? Inviting hundreds of bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I am going to do laundry, watch TV, order Indian food and go to bed early.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And then come the bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I may even fall asleep on the couch with the TV on.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: When do the bikers and lowlifes get to trash the place?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're all packed.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory, you have to do something bad when Mommy's out of town. It's the law. You're seen Risky Business, right? Now I'm not asking for a prostitution ring, but how about a floating craps game or something?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'll see what I can do.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I would greatly appreciate it.<\/p>\n<p>[a car honks from outside]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I think Grandma's here.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What's she honking for? She hates honking. She calls it a mechanical bodily function.

So, are we all ready to go?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I guess so, Miss Daisy. Bye sweets.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Bye. Bye Grandma.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Goodbye Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Have a good time.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Bikers and lowlifes.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'll get right on it.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM<\/p>\n<p>TEACHER: In general, the lab reports weren't bad but they weren't great either, which leads me to question whether everyone has the grasp of electrochemistry I prefer before we move on. To that end, I will be giving another test on Tuesday covering chapters fourteen through eighteen in your textbooks, as well as the material from lab. Now please proceed with the assignment we all started yesterday, as that too will be included on the test.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Madeline?<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: What?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: What are you guys doing tonight?<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: It's Friday night.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: So you've got dates?<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: Well, yeah, why?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: I was kind of hoping you could study with me.<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: On a Friday night?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: But we've got dates.<\/p>\n<p>LOUISE: What is she saying?<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: She wants us to study with her.<\/p>\n<p>LOUISE: On a Friday night?<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LOUISE: But we've got dates.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: I know you have dates, I was hoping maybe you'd cancel them.<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: To study?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: On a Friday night?<\/p>\n<p>LOUISE: What'd she say?<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: She wants us to cancel our dates to study.<\/p>\n<p>LOUISE: On a Friday night?<\/p>\n<p>MADELINE: That's what she said.<\/p>\n<p>LOUISE: But we have - .<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Oh my God, forget it! [walks over to Rory] So, I suppose that you have big Friday night plans also?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, kind of.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: So the fact that I'm seeing my entire Harvard career slip away apparently is of no interest to anyone?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What are you talking about?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: I got an A-minus, okay?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: What do you mean, so? I got an A-minus. I have never gotten an A-minus. I just can't focus lately. Things are so weird at my house. My dad finally figured out exactly how much it was gonna cost him to divorce my mom, so now he's back and it's bad enough that I wasted all that time crunching the numbers with him, but now that he's back, they're fighting and redecorating. The place is a mess. I need help.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Look, I can't tonight, but if you're still freaked out after the quiz on Tuesday, I will spend everyday next week helping you prepare for the final, okay?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: I guess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Relax. It will be fine, I promise.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: All I had to do was move a decimal point and none of this would've happened.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA<\/p>\n<p>[Emily and Lorelai walk into the lobby]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, look at this place. It's lovely. And that smell what is that, eucalyptus?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, it's lovely. Oh Lorelai, come over here, look. They have cucumber slices in the water.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh wow! Now if they have ranch dressing in the soap dispensers, this place is great.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You know what? I love it here.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hm. Careful Mom, that's how they get you in the Moonies.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I feel more relaxed already. Mm, that's the most delicious water I've ever had. Have a sip.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Let's just check in, shall we?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Okay. [they walk to the front desk] Hello, I'm Emily Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>BOBBY: Ah, yes, welcome to Birch Grove. My name is Bobby. I have everything all set for you. Do you have luggage?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, it's in the Luca Brasi mobile out front.<\/p>\n<p>BOBBY: Okay, well, we can take care of that for you. Here are your room keys and a copy of all of your spa activities. You ladies are booked solid, I see.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, we intend to leave here completely different people.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, I'm going to be Ted Nugent.<\/p>\n<p>BOBBY: Anyhow, your rooms are right down this hall. Fruit and yogurt is served by the pool in the mornings, and your lunch and dinner seatings are on that itinerary. Any questions?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, where can one get a cup of coffee around here?<\/p>\n<p>BOBBY: Ah, we don't serve anything with caffeine here.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And you think that's safe?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Thank you, Bobby. We're sure we're going to have a wonderful time.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, there's no coffee.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It won't k*ll you to go two days without coffee, Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I think it will.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Lorelai, just focus on all the pampering we're going to have. Look at all the wonderful things we have to look forward to.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh no.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, um, I'll be right back. They screwed up our appointments.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Again?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What do you mean, again?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, on the way to your house I called to confirm our schedule and found out they had us booked separately for every single one of our treatments. Luckily, I insisted on speaking to a manager and was able to straighten everything out. Yes, those are right.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: They are?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I even had them move the pedicure tubs together in the same room so we can talk during it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, I'm really gonna need a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Have some cucumber water.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, see, that's not gonna do it because it's .<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Drink, Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: cucumber water.

J.D. Salinger seems to dig it.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You don't want me to come over?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, I just. . .I almost never get the house all to myself and I thought with my mom gone, I can finally do my laundry exactly the way I like it. You know, not just separated into whites and colors, but the colors separated into darks, mediums, and lights, with a separate pile for white T-shirts and T-shirts with some kind of writing on them, like, you know, Rock Star, Evil, or Kafka was here.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You wanna be alone to do laundry?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And watch TV and eat the Indian food that I love but my mom hates the smell of and go to bed early and. . .are you mad?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Why would I be mad? You wanna spend tonight alone.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But hey, tomorrow, the whole day is all about you. I mean it, from morning til night. You plan it, or I'll plan it, or we can get a professional to plan it, whatever you want. Just don't be mad.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I'm not. I'm not mad.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Good.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I'm confused, but I'm not mad.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Fine<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I'm a saint, but I'm not mad.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You're welcome.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So, deep breath and. . .<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai is in her room unpacking. She hears knocking and opens the door to the hallway. No one's there, so she opens another door. Emily walks in wearing a bathrobe.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: How do I look?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Like a landlady. What is this?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I got adjoining rooms so we don't have to go out in the hallway to get to each other.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Great thinking!<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: God, this robe is fabulous. How do they get it so soft?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I think having about forty other people wear it first is part of the secret.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, stop it. So are you all ready for our skin rejuvenating and revitalizing collagen facial and eye treatment?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Almost.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it, which is the hottest thing in skin care these days. And the eye treatment is supposed to reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, no more brochures for you. All right, I'm ready, let's go.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Aren't you gonna wear your robe?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Your robe, you're supposed to wear your robe.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, well, I'm sure they'll give me one when I get there.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: But these robes are wonderful.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: They help you relax.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We're late, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: They're wonderful, relaxing robes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh my God.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And yet, you stand there like it's some badge of honor not to put on your robe like everyone else in this place. [Lorelai goes into the bathroom to change] This isn't for me, you know, it's for you. I already have on my robe. I'm already relaxed. What are you doing?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [from bathroom] You're kidding me, right?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, hurry up, we're gonna be late.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [opens bathroom door] Happy?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Apparently you didn't see the matching slippers.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO FACIAL ROOM<\/p>\n<p>FACIALIST: So, how are we doing?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So good.<\/p>\n<p>FACIALIST: Okay. Well, I'm gonna leave you to sit for a few minutes, so just relax and enjoy, and I'll be right back.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thanks.<\/p>\n<p>[As the facialist leaves, Lorelai closes her eyes. Emily quietly enters the room and sits down next to Lorelai.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Are your feet sweating?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Those booties make my feet sweat. Don't they make your feet sweat?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What are you doing in my room?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Magda left me sitting for twenty minutes. Fine time to take a coffee break.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: She's not taking a coffee break. Your skin is supposed to be absorbing the moisture in your mask in your room.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Let's see what's next on our agenda, shall we? Stop moving Lorelai, you'll electrocute yourself. Ooh, the Egyptian mud bath. I wonder if the mud bath is one of those things you see in brochures where they wrap you in towels like you're in a cocoon of some sort. That might be nice. Especially if their towels are as good as their robes because I just love these robes. I wonder where they get these robes. Shouldn't be so hard to find the manufacturer. I could order a few of them. One for me, one for you and one for Rory.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO HALLWAY<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Emily walk down the hallway in their robes]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I still can't get over it, it really was mud. I mean, I know it said mud bath but I didn't really think they meant a real mud bath. And the odd thing is I should've been more repulsed by it. Sitting in a tub of hot dirt, which is basically what mud is, should've made me ill, and yet I really enjoyed it. Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs, and when I asked the woman about them, she told me they were there because of the healing qualities. . .<\/p>\n<p>[they walk through a door marked Quiet Room.' A few seconds later, the door opens and Lorelai ushers Emily out into the hall]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What are you doing? Lorelai, stop it! You're pushing me!<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai bangs on the door, showing Emily the Quiet Room' sign, then they walk back into the room]<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO MASSAGE ROOM<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Emily are both getting massages.]<\/p>\n<p>MASSEUR: How's the pressure too much?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yup.<\/p>\n<p>MASSEUR: Sorry, I'll go lighter.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Your hands are amazing. Compliment your masseur's hands, Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh my God.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Excuse me?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You were muttering under your breath. Years of experience have taught me that when you do that, it's usually about me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, you signed us up for a couple's massage.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: So?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: A couple's massage is for a couple not a couple of people.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It's more efficient this way. We'll both be finished at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, do you know what most people who get these massages do about five minutes after it's over? They have s*x, together, probably while wearing their robes.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Could the two of you excuse us for a moment please? Thank you. [the masseurs leave] Well, that was appalling!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, that was true!<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You're just determined to spoil this, aren't you, Lorelai?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Why, because I want a quiet, private massage?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You've been pouting and sulking and sighing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, I have not been sighing.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Rolling your eyes, mumbling.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, that's how I detox.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Ever since we got here, you've made it your mission to be as miserable as possible.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's not true.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It's completely true. And if you don't care that you're hurting my feelings, maybe you care that you're wasting all your relaxing time acting like a petulant four-year-old.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Do you want me to try to get myself another room?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I saw a supply closet down the hall. Maybe my masseur could finish me in there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Or perhaps I could just roll myself against a stucco wall, eliminate the need for a masseur altogether.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Lie down Mom, please.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: If you say so. Lorelai?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, Mom?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Would you go get the boys, please?<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[Rory, while on the phone, is sitting on the living room floor surrounded by piles of clothes]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, that's two orders of garlic gnon, three simosas, and a chicken vindiloo. And rice, and the green sauce, and no salad, and. . . oh wait, sorry. Can you hold on a sec? [answers the call waiting] Hello?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hi, this is Phil's Liquor. I'm supposed to be delivering a keg there tonight.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hold on. [switches to other call] Hi, sorry. Yeah, that's it. Forty minutes, great. Bye. [switches back] Hey.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Who was that?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Sandeep's.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, you're ordering the Indian food?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yup.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good, enjoy. Can you burn the house down afterward, cause that's the only way we'll get the smell out.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Absolutely. How's the spa?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Tranquil.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Really?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I wasn't done. Tranquilizers, uh, will be required if I have to spend one more minute with my mother.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Please tell me you're at least trying to get along with her?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, hey, I'm being a peach.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Really?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I smell like a peach. Was that the doorbell?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, I'll call you later.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh wait, I wanna find out who it is.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: The sooner you get back to your weekend, the sooner it'll be over.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, but before you go, can you get out my address book and count how many friends I have? I'll wait.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Bye.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mean!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Steal me soap! [hangs up the phone, then opens the front door] Paris. What -.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: I tried to stay home and study myself but I can't. I don't know what anything means anymore. I mean, I can't even read my own handwriting. What does this say? The person who wrote this should be dressed in a clown suit stuffing bodies under their porch. You're in your pajamas.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: This was the big night you had planned a rendezvous with Mr. Peanut?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well...<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You're doing laundry.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You're doing laundry in your pajamas.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: My mom is out of town and I never get the house all to myself.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You mean you never get to go months on end without seeing your parents, just getting an occasional postcard that doesn't even have a courtesy &quot;Wish you were here&quot; written on it? That does suck. Don't let me stand in your way.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Paris, wait.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: No, forget it, I don't want to get in the way of your big night. I hear there's gonna be some hot knitting going on later.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Fine, I'll study with you.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You will?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: For one hour, that's it. We can do a quick review and a pop quiz and then you are going home. Deal?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Deal.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, so, go sit on the couch. I'll be out in the minute.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Where are you going?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm going to go change.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Okay, but my hour doesn't start until you get back out here, right?<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA<\/p>\n<p>[Emily walks into Lorelai's room]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Are you ready?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Wow, you look great, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Are you being sarcastic?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I'm being completely serious.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, well, thank you. That's a pretty color. What is that?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's called Vicious Trollop.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, stop it! Now why would you name a lipstick something like that?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Cause dirty whore' was taken?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You frighten me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You wanna try some?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: No, thank you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Go on, Mom, try it.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It won't look good on me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sure it will.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, all right, but if I look ridiculous. . .<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'll be the first one to point it out. You're a vicious trollop, you're a vicious trollop.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sorry.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I like it.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You do? I like it too.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good, let's go then, I'm starving.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, me too. What are they serving for dinner tonight?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, let's see. [looks at menu] Hmm.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: They certainly do like their tofu here, don't they?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And the word steamed. Well, they have dessert at least. Cookies sweetened with sprouted mungbean.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That sounds dreadful.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, it does.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Where are you going? You aren't going to change, are you? Our seating's in ten minutes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Get your coat.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I don't need a coat to go to the dining room.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We're not going to the dining room.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, where are we going?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Out.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Out where?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We're gonna leave the spa, find a restaurant, and have a steak.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: A steak?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Who's gonna stop us?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: A steak.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Come on, Mom.

[doorbell rings; Rory walks toward the door] Where are you going?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's my food.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Another half hour, please!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, you got your hour.

Jess is holding a box of food]<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Delivery.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What are you doing here?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Well, Luke figured since you're along tonight that maybe you wouldn't have any food in the house, so he sent over a care package.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I don't need a care package. I ordered food from Sandeep's.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Really? Planning on burning down the house afterwards?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Jess.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: The only way to k*ll the smell. Where should I put this?

There's nothing but banging and yelling. That place gives me a headache.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Why did you think I wanted to come over here and see you?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Just needed some quiet.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Fine.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: That is all.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Got it.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Clear my head.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I understand.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: So, aren't you gonna eat?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Eventually.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: It gets cold fast.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I can heat it up.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Reheated French fries really suck.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hm, they do suck.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Yeah, so, eat.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, I will.

Uh, well, I can take your name, but I probably won't have a table for about an hour.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: An hour!<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I can't wait an hour.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Me either.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'll pass out.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Go first, you can break my fall.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Can we bribe you?<\/p>\n<p>HOSTESS: Sorry.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Please?

Come on.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We cannot eat dinner at a bar.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't wanna wait an hour, and I'm wearing the wrong shoes for a drive thru.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: But what are people going to think?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That we're loose women with questionable morals.<\/p>\n<p>[they sit down at the bar]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Doesn't seem right to eat dinner when your feet aren't touching the floor.<\/p>\n<p>BARTENDER: What can I get you ladies?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hi Steve, nice to meet you. We will have two. . .martinis?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Why not?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Two vodka martinis, straight up with a twist, very dry, very cold, and a couple of menus, please.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And some peanuts.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah, peanuts, good idea.<\/p>\n<p>BARTENDER: Here you go, I'll get your drinks.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thank you. You're a good man, Steve. Okay, I'm thinking steak and Caesar salad if it's not too anchovy-y, and hey do you wanna split a shrimp cocktail to start?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That sounds fine.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah, I just love the idea of shrimp cocktail with a steak dinner, you know? It's so Casino, Big Joe, steak and shrimp hey, save some for winter, there.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I never realized how wonderful peanuts were before.<\/p>\n<p>BARTENDER: Want a refill?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, yes, please.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Cheers, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Cheers. I must tell you, I never expected this.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Me inhaling peanuts at a singles bar.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: This isn't a singles bar, Mom. It's a sixty-forty bar.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: A what?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sixty-year-old men hitting on forty-year-old women, divorcees mostly.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Really?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Look around.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Hm. Oh, now, she can do better than that. What does she see in him?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Big will, short life span, the usual draw.

I have one word for Jack Kerouac edit.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: It was not self-indulgent. The Beats believed in shocking people, stirring things up.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: They believed in drugs, booze, and petty crime.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, then you can say that they exposed you to a world you wouldn't have otherwise known. Isn't that what great writing's all about?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: That was not great writing. That was the National Enquirer of the fifties.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: You're cracked.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Typical guy response. Worship Kerouac and Bukowski, God forbid you'd pick up anything by Jane Austen.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Hey, I've read Jane Austen.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You have?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Yeah, and I think she would've liked Bukowski.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: What are you doing?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Salt and pepper dip. Only way to eat a fry.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Really?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It's fast food gospel.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Mm. That's good. That's really, really good.<\/p>\n<p>[phone rings]<\/p>\n<p>JESS: You like hot sauce?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: I don't know.

[hangs up]<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I can't get into poetry. It's kind of like, geez, just say it already, we're dying here.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow, you know, I just noticed the time, and it's getting really late.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: It's seven o'clock.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know, but Paris and I still have a lot more studying to do. Jess, please thank Luke for me. It was really nice of him.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Who was on the phone?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No one.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: No one wouldn't happen to be heading over here now, would he?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Jess.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: What's going on?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Dean's on his way over and Rory doesn't want him to find me here.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Why?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Yeah, why?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You know why.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: We're just eating dinner.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Jess, I'm asking you as a friend, just please leave now.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: You really want me to go?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I really wanna avoid a fight with Dean.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Okay, I'm going.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Ow!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Ooh! I just twisted my ankle. I better go lie down.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Jess!<\/p>\n<p>JESS: God, you're no fun when you're tense. Are you sure you want me to go? Cause maybe this whole thing can be solved between me and Dean if we just sat down and had a little heart to heart. He can tell me his issues, I'll tell him mine.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Jess!<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I promise I'll speak slowly.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Bye! [pushes him out the front door]<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Okay, well, give him my best, would ya?

Is that ice cream? That's so nice. A tiny little ice cream package just big enough for two. Hey, are you guys gonna feed each other cause that's just so darn cute. Oops. You're doing that towering over me thing. Huh. I tell you, you've really got that down. It helps that you're twelve feet tall, but this Frankenstein scowl really adds to the whole .<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Jess.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Okay, I'm going. Look, man, I really was just dropping off some food, so don't get all West Side Story on me, okay? [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So, do you wanna. . . [Dean walks into the house] . . .come in?<\/p>\n<p>[cut to kitchen]<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: What the hell is going on?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Hi.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Dean, you remember Paris, right?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, hi. So Jess just dropped this off, huh?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, well. . .<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Now I know you eat fast, but this is a lot of food to put away that quickly, even on your best day.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, so he didn't just drop it off but - .<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You told me you were doing laundry tonight.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I was.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: And now you are here with Jess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And Paris!<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Jess, Rory!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Ah, well, I swear, I didn't<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You didn't what? You didn't know he was coming over?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I didn't.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: And you also didn't know he was gonna stay, right?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It just happened.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: How does that just happen?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, he was. . .and the diner, the diner was. . .and I. . .<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: And you what? What? Say something!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Stop yelling!<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You totally lied to me!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I didn't!<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Turn the situation around, Rory! How's it looking?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It's looking complicated and I'm trying to explain it to you.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Ugh, that's crap.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: It's my fault.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: What?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: It's my fault that Jess was here. I saw him in the diner the day I came to Stars Hollow and I thought he was cute and since I'm not great at the whole batting the eyelashes, look at my belly shirt' kind of thing, I asked Rory to help me. I thought if she could maybe get him over here, we'd have a chance to talk and. . .I don't know, it seems totally stupid now and it obviously didn't work shock, but that's why he was here. Thanks for trying to cover for me.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's okay.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Anyway, I should get going. I'm probably gonna break out in some sort of rash any second now. [leaves kitchen]<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: So Paris likes Jess?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Rory, is this true?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes it is.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Paris and Jess?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know. There's no explaining attraction. Dean, listen to me, if I was going to have anyone over tonight, it definitely would've been you.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Okay.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Really?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Well, if you say so, then I have to believe it, don't I?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Well, okay then. I'm sorry that I yelled.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Completely justified under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I'm gonna get going.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, wait, don't you wanna stay for ice cream? We could hang out.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Nah, I'm just gonna go.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm still seeing you tomorrow, right?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, sure.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hey.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: See you tomorrow. [leaves]<\/p>\n<p>[Rory walks into the living room]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What was that?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: What?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That, the story, the save? You helped me. Why would you do that?<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: I don't know, it just came out.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You have no idea what you did.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: It was no big deal.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, it was a very big deal. It was a huge deal.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Well, you helped me tonight when you didn't want to, so I owed you.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You're welcome. Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your alone night.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You should stay.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Stay?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah. We could hang out, maybe watch some TV. You can even spend the night if you don't wanna drive all the way back to Hartford.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Spend the night, like a slumber party?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Sort of.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: You're just doing this because I lied to Dean for you, right?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm doing this because it's what you do with friends.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: We're friends?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm not sure if there is an exact definition for what we are, but I do think it falls somewhere in the bizarro friends-ish realm. Come on, stay.<\/p>\n<p>PARIS: Okay. But if you're doing all this so you can freeze my bra, I'll k*ll you.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Duly noted.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO RESTAURANT<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Emily are eating dinner.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: This is either the greatest steak I've ever eaten, or I'm so hungry, I'm delirious. Pass the horseradish, please.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I never knew you were a spicy girl.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, believe me, I can handle my heat. One summer when we were first married, your father and I stayed at this little village in Thailand where we spent two weeks eating viciously hot chilies and skinny-dipping.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ah, Mom!<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, you certainly couldn't put your clothes on after eating those things.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Stop it! I like to think of parents the old fashioned way separate bedrooms.<\/p>\n<p>FEMALE SINGER: And now it's time for my favorite part of the evening our salute to the Chairman of the Board.<\/p>\n<p>MALE SINGER: I sure hope that's not b-o-r-e-d.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Uh, uh, Mom?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Remember the man who wasn't staring at you?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: He wasn't staring at me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, well, he's coming over.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What?<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting, but I couldn't help but notice that you two are having more fun than anyone at the bar.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, that's true, we are.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Well, good, I've come to the right place. Hi, I'm Chad.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hi Chad. I'm Lorelai. This is my mother, Emily.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Your mother?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Chad, if the next words out of your mouth are, you can't possibly be old enough to be her mother,' I'm gonna have to cause you severe physical pain.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Emily, do you share this rather extreme opinion?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I think I'll stay out of it.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: In that case, let me just say that I think you look more like sisters than mother and daughter. Yeah, I went for a variation.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'll let it slide this time.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: So, are you two, uh, local or just visiting?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Visiting. Mom's from Hartford and I'm from a town, uh<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Hartford? Great town, great town. A little of the old, little of the new. You like living there?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, yes, I do.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And how about you, Chad where do you live?<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Here and by here, I mean this very bar stool.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Wow, admitting right off the bat that you spend your life at a bar. Do you find that people are impressed by that?<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Until now.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, I love this song.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: It's a great song for dancing.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes, it is.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Help me out here, will ya?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I think he's asking you to dance, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: What? Oh, no, I, uh, I couldn't.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Rumor has it you love this song.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, well, yes, but I don't dance.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Oh, come on. I can't believe that.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And I shouldn't leave my daughter alone.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's okay. The sitter'll be here any minute.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Really, I'm serious, you should ask someone else.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Is it my dancing? Because you two could work out some kind of save me' signal in case I really embarrass you.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Go ahead, Mom. It'll be fun.<\/p>\n<p>CHAD: Come on, the song's almost over. You'll hardly have to spend any time at all with me.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: All right.<\/p>\n<p>[they start dancing]<\/p>\n<p>BARTENDER: Hey, your mom looks good out there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yup, she sure does.<\/p>\n<p>[When the song ends, Emily starts to walk away but Chad pulls her closer for another dance. After a few seconds, Emily breaks away from him.]<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I'm sorry, I have to go.<\/p>\n<p>[She quickly walks over to the coat check area. Lorelai gets up and follows her]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, what's wrong?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We're leaving.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What happened?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I shouldn't have been doing this.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Doing what?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Fraternizing with other men.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, what are you talking about?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I practically cheated on your father.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You did not cheat on Dad.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I danced with another man.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You've danced with other men before.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Not like that, not without your father present.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, Mom, it was just a dance. You were having fun.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I need to get out of here. How hard is it to find a coat?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, you didn't do anything wrong.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I don't know why I let you take me to this chop house in the first place. I don't go to chop houses. What were you thinking?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Need food now.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: And I certainly don't eat at bars. Hookers eat at bars.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Only if they can't get a table.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You're not funny. You knew this whole evening made me uncomfortable and yet you kept pushing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I was trying to do everything right. You manipulated me into taking this trip and still I came. You told me I was acting like a teenager, so I tried to be nicer. You said you needed to eat, so I made that happen.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes, by sitting me at a bar where you practically forced me to engage in inappropriate behavior.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You let me get sixty-fortied!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You are crazy! Do you know that? We were having dinner, Mom, a nice dinner. We were talking. Hell, we were having fun.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, so watching your mother make an ass of herself was fun for you?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: God, you know, you don't have any right to complain about this relationship if you're not willing to let your guard down once in awhile and just be normal.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: There's a way for a mother to behave in front of her daughter. I'm sorry if you don't like it, but that's how it is.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai is in her room, packing. There's a knock on the door.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Come in.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I called the bellman to get the bags. He said it would be around ten minutes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Thank you for agreeing to leave early.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No problem.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I guess this whole thing was a silly idea anyway. I don't know why I pushed it. We can't even get through a dinner without a fight. What was I thinking putting us together for a weekend?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It was a nice thought, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Yes, well, I guess it's the thought that counts, isn't it?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You know, if you want, um, I can just bring our bags down. I mean, they're not that heavy, and then we don't have to wait.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, that sounds fine. Why can't we have what you and Rory have?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory and I are different mom.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We're mother and daughter, you're mother and daughter. It shouldn't be that different.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's completely different. It couldn't be more different.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: But why?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I grew up in a different environment.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You mean an oppressive environment.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, Mom, I mean a different environment. And plus, I was so young when I had Rory.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: So because I waited until I was grown and married, I can't have a relationship with my daughter?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, then, why?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory and I are best friends, Mom. We are best friends first and mother and daughter second, and you and I are mother and daughter always.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I wasn't taught to be best friends with my daughter.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I was taught to be a role model for my daughter.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know that, too.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I did what I thought was right. I did what I thought I had to do to protect you, and because of this we have no relationship.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, Mom, we have a relationship.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We do? What? What is our relationship?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, we. . .<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Exactly.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Maybe an intense weekend together was not the best idea for us. Maybe we need to start with something simpler.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Like what, a brisk walk around the block?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I hate exercise.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Oh, well, as long as you find this amusing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, come on. There has to be something else. Something small.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Like what? Where are you going? Lorelai, you just don't walk out on a person. That's rude. That's a robe.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, this is my robe. And I want you to go into your room and get your robe. And then, exactly at the same time, we are gonna shove these robes in our suitcases and we are gonna walk out that door and leave with them.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That's stealing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, it is.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You want me to steal a robe? That's how we're going to bond?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mom, you love this robe. You've talked about nothing else except this robe since we got here, so this robe will be symbolic of our trip together.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: But that's crazy. As soon as they check the rooms, they're going to know the robes are gone and then they're going to charge our credit card.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, how do you know?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Because that's what the little tag on the hanger says.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, the little tag on the hanger could be right, or the little tag on the hanger could just be there trying to scare us away from trying. Either way, whether we get away with it or not, it's something we did, you and I.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You're serious.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I am folding this robe up.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Lorelai.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I am putting this robe in my bag.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: That's lunacy.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I am zipping up the bag that contains the robe.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I have a perfectly good robe at home.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Now the only question is, am I doing it alone?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Did you ever steal a robe with Rory?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, Rory would never steal. She's far too moral for that. You, however, vicious trollop what's it gonna be?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I should have my head examined.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: We'll make an appointment when we get back.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: You do know, in the course of one night, you've turned me into an adulterer and a thief.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'll have you working at the chicken ranch by the end of the month.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I cannot believe I'm doing this.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LUKE'S DINER<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You actually got Grandma to steal a bathrobe?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Although I did catch her trying to return it while I was getting the car.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Still.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know, life with my mother, one step forward, five thousand steps back. It's kinda like the spastic polka.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: Excuse me, are you done?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, uh, sorry, not yet.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: So, you're gonna eat that half a piece of bacon that's been sitting there for ten minutes?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Kirk.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: I mean, of course, you must be if you're saying you're not done because that's the only thing left in front on you, unless you eat plates.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Go away.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: You are hogging the table.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You keep it up, I'm ordering seconds.<\/p>\n<p>KIRK: Fine.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So, Paris looked a little green this morning.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, she had a sugar/carb hangover of monumental proportions.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: People don't realize it, but it takes years of training to be able to eat the way we do.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Don't I know it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So, what's on the agenda for today?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Let's see. Dean, Dean, and uh. . .oh, did I mention Dean?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Wow, he must've been crazy mad last night.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'd say that was a fair assessment.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, I gotta get to the inn.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay. Well, I'm probably gonna have dinner with Dean, so. . .<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'll have the house to myself tonight. Life's funny, isn't it?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I simply cannot stop laughing. I'll get the check.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thanks hon.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: [walks to the counter] Hey Luke.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What, you find a nail in your food? I swear to God, Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: There's nothing wrong with the food, Luke.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Oh, sorry Tom.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I just wanted to thank you.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Yeah, for what?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: For the care package. It was really sweet of you.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: What care package?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Hey Luke, I think they hit the water line again.<\/p>\n<p>LUKE: Oh, what? [walks away] Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Huh, interesting.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Hey, you wanna pay?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I don't think Luke knew anything about the food last night.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: That'll be twelve-fifty.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Which means you lied about why you came over.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I don't have any quarters. I'm gonna have to give you nickels.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Now why would you lie about something like that?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Here's your change. Come again soon.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You wanted to come over.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: I have to get back to work.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're squirming. I've never seen you squirm. It's entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Oh yeah?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO OUTSIDE<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai walks out of the diner. Dean is standing out front.]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Dean, hey.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Hey.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory's just inside paying. She's coming out to meet you after.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, we're gonna spend the day together.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's great.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, it is.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: So, listen, Rory told me everything that happened last night. She feels just terrible about it.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I know.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Good, you should. It's just one of those freaky unfortunate things that happens.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Freaky and unfortunate, yeah.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: She had nothing to do with Jess coming over. Believe me, she did not want him there.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: That's what she told me. And Rory wouldn't lie, right?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, Rory wouldn't lie.<\/p>\n<p>THE END<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"javascript:var handle=window.open('http://foreverdreaming.org/')\">F.D.<\/a><b> &raquo; <\/b><a href=\"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/index.php?sid=1205ec56d1132393e5932219bdfbd367\">Transcripts<\/a><b> &raquo; <\/b><a href=\"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=503&sid=1205ec56d1132393e5932219bdfbd367\">G<\/a><b> &raquo; <\/b><a href=\"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=22&sid=1205ec56d1132393e5932219bdfbd367\">Gilmore Girls<\/a><\/p>","text":"2.16 - There's the Rub\nwritten by Sheila R. Lawrence\ndirected by Amy Sherman-Palladino\nOPEN IN LUKE'S DINER\n[Luke's apartment is under construction. Luke delivers food to some customers, a chunk of the ceiling falls onto the table.]\nLUKE: Here you go. Geez, uh, sorry folks. Uh, here. . .there we go. Free coffee all around. You might wanna put your hand over that. There we go. [walks over to construction worker] Tom, what the hell is going on up there?\nTOM: We're redoing your apartment. What do you think is going on up there?\nLUKE: The ceiling's falling in. I've got customers eating drywall here.\nTOM: Oh, well, that can't be good.\nLUKE: You said minimal disruptions.\nTOM: Hey, this is minimal disruptions. Look, I need you to sign this change order.\nLUKE: What happened now?\nTOM: Well, we broke through this wall and we found some pipes that shouldn't be there. We gotta move them.\nLUKE: Move them where?\nTOM: Not sure. We gotta find out what they do first.\nLUKE: You're kidding?\nTOM: Oh yeah. There's nothing I like more than a good moving a pipe' joke.\nLUKE: Fine, one more week, that's it.\nTOM: Oh, sure, construction ultimatum. Ha, that's even funnier than my moving pipe joke.\n[Lorelai and Rory walk in]\nLORELAI: Hey.\nLUKE: Hey.\nLORELAI: Geez, look at this place.\nRORY: It's a mess.\nLORELAI: How long .\nLUKE: Nope can't sit here.\nLORELAI: Why not?\nLUKE: Three people got nailed in the head here earlier.\nLORELAI: But their food was okay, right?\nLUKE: Will you just move? [Lorelai's cell phone rings] Outside.\nLORELAI: You know, if I sit here one more second, I just might be outside. Order me some coffee.\n[Lorelai walks away; Jess walks over to the table and hands Rory an open umbrella]\nLUKE: Oh, you are really funny. You and Tom should put an act together. I'd leave it open.\n[cut to outside]\nLORELAI: Go ahead Mom, I can hear you now.\nEMILY: I wanted to know if you'd like a gift certificate for a weekend at the Birch Grove Spa.\nLORELAI: Are you serious?\nEMILY: I bid on it at the DAR Symphony Fundraiser and I won.\nLORELAI: Birch Grove? That's supposed to be an amazing place, why don't you go?\nEMILY: Oh, I've never had any real desire to go to a spa.\nLORELAI: Why'd you bid on it then?\nEMILY: It was for charity, I had to bid on something. And I certainly didn't want another portrait of George Washington. I've got four in the attic already.\nLORELAI: Well, I'd love it.\nEMILY: Good.\nLORELAI: Two days of total mind-numbing pampering. Massages, facials, aromatherapy.\nEMILY: My goodness, you make it sound like heaven.\nLORELAI: It's as close as you'll ever come to being a dog.\nEMILY: I beg your pardon?\nLORELAI: You know, a whole life of nothing but eating, sleeping, lying on your back and getting rubbed.\nEMILY: I'd love the comparison to stop there.\nLORELAI: Deal. Um, hey, when's it for?\nEMILY: This weekend, actually.\nLORELAI: Oh, well, I'll be there.\nEMILY: So will I.\nLORELAI: Excuse me?\nEMILY: Well, the certificate is for two, and since you make it sound like the most wonderful place in the world, I might as well try it with you.\nLORELAI: Oh, but - .\nEMILY: That's all right, isn't it, if I join you? You don't mind?\nLORELAI: No, I don't mind at all.\nEMILY: Wonderful. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. You know, I'm actually looking forward to this.\nLORELAI: Oh yeah, me too. Thanks Mom. Buh bye.\nCUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S\n[Rory is sitting at the table holding the umbrella over her head.

Uh, great. Thanks so much for your help. Okay, bye. [hangs up] Yeeessss!\nRORY: That was an evil yes.\nLORELAI: Not an evil yes. It's a yes, I'm pretty, but hello, I'm smart' kind of a yes.\nRORY: Oh, my mistake.\nLORELAI: So here's the deal I go into my facial just as my mother is finishing her salt glow, which will end ten minutes after I've hit my scalp treatment which puts me in the watsu massage pool at least six minutes into her back facial. Uh, in fact, the day is so well planned, I won't see her until dinner which will be cut tragically short by the food poisoning I plan to contract.\nRORY: You are twelve and disgusting.\nLORELAI: I am trapped and desperate.\nRORY: You really think you can avoid Grandma the entire weekend?\nLORELAI: Hey, I'm nothing if not a great organizer. Now, let's talk about what you're gonna do tonight. Throwing a party, I hope? Inviting hundreds of bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?\nRORY: I am going to do laundry, watch TV, order Indian food and go to bed early.\nLORELAI: And then come the bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?\nRORY: I may even fall asleep on the couch with the TV on.\nLORELAI: When do the bikers and lowlifes get to trash the place?\nRORY: You're all packed.\nLORELAI: Rory, you have to do something bad when Mommy's out of town. It's the law. You're seen Risky Business, right? Now I'm not asking for a prostitution ring, but how about a floating craps game or something?\nRORY: I'll see what I can do.\nLORELAI: I would greatly appreciate it.\n[a car honks from outside]\nRORY: I think Grandma's here.\nLORELAI: What's she honking for? She hates honking. She calls it a mechanical bodily function. [looks out window] Ugh, geez.\nRORY: [looks out window] Oh, cool!\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Emily is standing in front of a limousine as Rory and Lorelai walk out of the house]\nEMILY: Hello, hello, hello!\nLORELAI: What, are we going to the prom?\nEMILY: I just thought since this weekend is all about relaxing, we should start with the ride.\nRORY: This is cool, Grandma.\nEMILY: Thank you, Rory. So, are we all ready to go?\nLORELAI: I guess so, Miss Daisy. Bye sweets.\nRORY: Bye. Bye Grandma.\nEMILY: Goodbye Rory.\nRORY: Have a good time.\nLORELAI: Bikers and lowlifes.\nRORY: I'll get right on it.\nCUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM\nTEACHER: In general, the lab reports weren't bad but they weren't great either, which leads me to question whether everyone has the grasp of electrochemistry I prefer before we move on. To that end, I will be giving another test on Tuesday covering chapters fourteen through eighteen in your textbooks, as well as the material from lab. Now please proceed with the assignment we all started yesterday, as that too will be included on the test.\nPARIS: Madeline?\nMADELINE: What?\nPARIS: What are you guys doing tonight?\nMADELINE: It's Friday night.\nPARIS: So you've got dates?\nMADELINE: Well, yeah, why?\nPARIS: I was kind of hoping you could study with me.\nMADELINE: On a Friday night?\nPARIS: Yes.\nMADELINE: But we've got dates.\nLOUISE: What is she saying?\nMADELINE: She wants us to study with her.\nLOUISE: On a Friday night?\nMADELINE: Yeah.\nLOUISE: But we've got dates.\nPARIS: I know you have dates, I was hoping maybe you'd cancel them.\nMADELINE: To study?\nPARIS: Yes.\nMADELINE: On a Friday night?\nLOUISE: What'd she say?\nMADELINE: She wants us to cancel our dates to study.\nLOUISE: On a Friday night?\nMADELINE: That's what she said.\nLOUISE: But we have - .\nPARIS: Oh my God, forget it! [walks over to Rory] So, I suppose that you have big Friday night plans also?\nRORY: Well, kind of.\nPARIS: So the fact that I'm seeing my entire Harvard career slip away apparently is of no interest to anyone?\nRORY: What are you talking about?\nPARIS: I got an A-minus, okay?\nRORY: So?\nPARIS: What do you mean, so? I got an A-minus. I have never gotten an A-minus. I just can't focus lately. Things are so weird at my house. My dad finally figured out exactly how much it was gonna cost him to divorce my mom, so now he's back and it's bad enough that I wasted all that time crunching the numbers with him, but now that he's back, they're fighting and redecorating. The place is a mess. I need help.\nRORY: Look, I can't tonight, but if you're still freaked out after the quiz on Tuesday, I will spend everyday next week helping you prepare for the final, okay?\nPARIS: I guess.\nRORY: Relax. It will be fine, I promise.\nPARIS: All I had to do was move a decimal point and none of this would've happened.\nCUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA\n[Emily and Lorelai walk into the lobby]\nEMILY: Oh, look at this place. It's lovely. And that smell what is that, eucalyptus?\nLORELAI: I don't know.\nEMILY: Well, it's lovely. Oh Lorelai, come over here, look. They have cucumber slices in the water.\nLORELAI: Oh wow! Now if they have ranch dressing in the soap dispensers, this place is great.\nEMILY: You know what? I love it here.\nLORELAI: Hm. Careful Mom, that's how they get you in the Moonies.\nEMILY: I feel more relaxed already. Mm, that's the most delicious water I've ever had. Have a sip.\nLORELAI: Let's just check in, shall we?\nEMILY: Okay. [they walk to the front desk] Hello, I'm Emily Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai.\nBOBBY: Ah, yes, welcome to Birch Grove. My name is Bobby. I have everything all set for you. Do you have luggage?\nLORELAI: Yes, it's in the Luca Brasi mobile out front.\nBOBBY: Okay, well, we can take care of that for you. Here are your room keys and a copy of all of your spa activities. You ladies are booked solid, I see.\nEMILY: Well, we intend to leave here completely different people.\nLORELAI: Yes, I'm going to be Ted Nugent.\nBOBBY: Anyhow, your rooms are right down this hall. Fruit and yogurt is served by the pool in the mornings, and your lunch and dinner seatings are on that itinerary. Any questions?\nLORELAI: Yes, where can one get a cup of coffee around here?\nBOBBY: Ah, we don't serve anything with caffeine here.\nLORELAI: And you think that's safe?\nEMILY: Thank you, Bobby. We're sure we're going to have a wonderful time.\nLORELAI: Mom, there's no coffee.\nEMILY: It won't k*ll you to go two days without coffee, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: No, I think it will.\nEMILY: Lorelai, just focus on all the pampering we're going to have. Look at all the wonderful things we have to look forward to.\nLORELAI: Oh no.\nEMILY: What?\nLORELAI: Oh, um, I'll be right back. They screwed up our appointments.\nEMILY: Again?\nLORELAI: What do you mean, again?\nEMILY: Well, on the way to your house I called to confirm our schedule and found out they had us booked separately for every single one of our treatments. Luckily, I insisted on speaking to a manager and was able to straighten everything out. Yes, those are right.\nLORELAI: They are?\nEMILY: I even had them move the pedicure tubs together in the same room so we can talk during it.\nLORELAI: Okay, I'm really gonna need a cup of coffee.\nEMILY: Have some cucumber water.\nLORELAI: No, see, that's not gonna do it because it's .\nEMILY: Drink, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: cucumber water. Yuck.\nCUT TO STARS HOLLOW\n[Rory and Dean are kissing by a tree]\nRORY: Wow, your lung capacity certainly has improved.\nDEAN: Well, I've been playing a lot more basketball lately.\nRORY: Yet another reason to continue the fight to keep physical education in schools.\nDEAN: So, tonight.\nRORY: Yes?\nDEAN: I was thinking.\nRORY: Yes?\nDEAN: Since your mother's gonna be gone.\nRORY: Mm hmm.\nDEAN: Maybe I'd come over.\nRORY: Oh.\nDEAN: What?\nRORY: Actually, I was thinking of pulling kind of a hermit thing tonight.\nDEAN: Why?\nRORY: I don't know. J.D. Salinger seems to dig it.\nDEAN: You don't want me to come over?\nRORY: No, I just. . .I almost never get the house all to myself and I thought with my mom gone, I can finally do my laundry exactly the way I like it. You know, not just separated into whites and colors, but the colors separated into darks, mediums, and lights, with a separate pile for white T-shirts and T-shirts with some kind of writing on them, like, you know, Rock Star, Evil, or Kafka was here.\nDEAN: You wanna be alone to do laundry?\nRORY: And watch TV and eat the Indian food that I love but my mom hates the smell of and go to bed early and. . .are you mad?\nDEAN: Why would I be mad? You wanna spend tonight alone.\nRORY: But hey, tomorrow, the whole day is all about you. I mean it, from morning til night. You plan it, or I'll plan it, or we can get a professional to plan it, whatever you want. Just don't be mad.\nDEAN: I'm not. I'm not mad.\nRORY: Good.\nDEAN: I'm confused, but I'm not mad.\nRORY: Fine\nDEAN: I'm a saint, but I'm not mad.\nRORY: Thank you.\nDEAN: You're welcome.\nRORY: So, deep breath and. . .\nCUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA\n[Lorelai is in her room unpacking. She hears knocking and opens the door to the hallway. No one's there, so she opens another door. Emily walks in wearing a bathrobe.]\nEMILY: How do I look?\nLORELAI: Like a landlady. What is this?\nEMILY: I got adjoining rooms so we don't have to go out in the hallway to get to each other.\nLORELAI: Great thinking!\nEMILY: God, this robe is fabulous. How do they get it so soft?\nLORELAI: Well, I think having about forty other people wear it first is part of the secret.\nEMILY: Oh, stop it. So are you all ready for our skin rejuvenating and revitalizing collagen facial and eye treatment?\nLORELAI: Almost.\nEMILY: It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it, which is the hottest thing in skin care these days. And the eye treatment is supposed to reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines.\nLORELAI: Okay, no more brochures for you. All right, I'm ready, let's go.\nEMILY: Aren't you gonna wear your robe?\nLORELAI: What?\nEMILY: Your robe, you're supposed to wear your robe.\nLORELAI: Oh, well, I'm sure they'll give me one when I get there.\nEMILY: But these robes are wonderful.\nLORELAI: Mom.\nEMILY: They help you relax.\nLORELAI: We're late, Mom.\nEMILY: They're wonderful, relaxing robes.\nLORELAI: Oh my God.\nEMILY: And yet, you stand there like it's some badge of honor not to put on your robe like everyone else in this place. [Lorelai goes into the bathroom to change] This isn't for me, you know, it's for you. I already have on my robe. I'm already relaxed. What are you doing?\nLORELAI: [from bathroom] You're kidding me, right?\nEMILY: Well, hurry up, we're gonna be late.\nLORELAI: [opens bathroom door] Happy?\nEMILY: Apparently you didn't see the matching slippers.\nCUT TO FACIAL ROOM\nFACIALIST: So, how are we doing?\nLORELAI: So good.\nFACIALIST: Okay. Well, I'm gonna leave you to sit for a few minutes, so just relax and enjoy, and I'll be right back.\nLORELAI: Thanks.\n[As the facialist leaves, Lorelai closes her eyes. Emily quietly enters the room and sits down next to Lorelai.]\nEMILY: Are your feet sweating?\nLORELAI: Mom?\nEMILY: Those booties make my feet sweat. Don't they make your feet sweat?\nLORELAI: What are you doing in my room?\nEMILY: Magda left me sitting for twenty minutes. Fine time to take a coffee break.\nLORELAI: She's not taking a coffee break. Your skin is supposed to be absorbing the moisture in your mask in your room.\nEMILY: Let's see what's next on our agenda, shall we? Stop moving Lorelai, you'll electrocute yourself. Ooh, the Egyptian mud bath. I wonder if the mud bath is one of those things you see in brochures where they wrap you in towels like you're in a cocoon of some sort. That might be nice. Especially if their towels are as good as their robes because I just love these robes. I wonder where they get these robes. Shouldn't be so hard to find the manufacturer. I could order a few of them. One for me, one for you and one for Rory.\nCUT TO HALLWAY\n[Lorelai and Emily walk down the hallway in their robes]\nEMILY: I still can't get over it, it really was mud. I mean, I know it said mud bath but I didn't really think they meant a real mud bath. And the odd thing is I should've been more repulsed by it. Sitting in a tub of hot dirt, which is basically what mud is, should've made me ill, and yet I really enjoyed it. Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs, and when I asked the woman about them, she told me they were there because of the healing qualities. . .\n[they walk through a door marked Quiet Room.' A few seconds later, the door opens and Lorelai ushers Emily out into the hall]\nEMILY: What are you doing? Lorelai, stop it! You're pushing me!\n[Lorelai bangs on the door, showing Emily the Quiet Room' sign, then they walk back into the room]\nCUT TO MASSAGE ROOM\n[Lorelai and Emily are both getting massages.]\nMASSEUR: How's the pressure too much?\nLORELAI: Yup.\nMASSEUR: Sorry, I'll go lighter.\nEMILY: Your hands are amazing. Compliment your masseur's hands, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Oh my God.\nEMILY: Excuse me?\nLORELAI: Nothing.\nEMILY: You were muttering under your breath. Years of experience have taught me that when you do that, it's usually about me.\nLORELAI: Mom, you signed us up for a couple's massage.\nEMILY: So?\nLORELAI: A couple's massage is for a couple not a couple of people.\nEMILY: It's more efficient this way. We'll both be finished at the same time.\nLORELAI: Mom, do you know what most people who get these massages do about five minutes after it's over? They have s*x, together, probably while wearing their robes.\nEMILY: Could the two of you excuse us for a moment please? Thank you. [the masseurs leave] Well, that was appalling!\nLORELAI: Well, that was true!\nEMILY: You're just determined to spoil this, aren't you, Lorelai?\nLORELAI: Why, because I want a quiet, private massage?\nEMILY: You've been pouting and sulking and sighing.\nLORELAI: Oh, I have not been sighing.\nEMILY: Rolling your eyes, mumbling.\nLORELAI: Well, that's how I detox.\nEMILY: Ever since we got here, you've made it your mission to be as miserable as possible.\nLORELAI: That's not true.\nEMILY: It's completely true. And if you don't care that you're hurting my feelings, maybe you care that you're wasting all your relaxing time acting like a petulant four-year-old.\nLORELAI: Well, I'm sorry.\nEMILY: Do you want me to try to get myself another room?\nLORELAI: No.\nEMILY: I saw a supply closet down the hall. Maybe my masseur could finish me in there.\nLORELAI: Okay, Mom.\nEMILY: Or perhaps I could just roll myself against a stucco wall, eliminate the need for a masseur altogether.\nLORELAI: Lie down Mom, please.\nEMILY: If you say so. Lorelai?\nLORELAI: Yes, Mom?\nEMILY: Would you go get the boys, please?\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Rory, while on the phone, is sitting on the living room floor surrounded by piles of clothes]\nRORY: No, that's two orders of garlic gnon, three simosas, and a chicken vindiloo. And rice, and the green sauce, and no salad, and. . . oh wait, sorry. Can you hold on a sec? [answers the call waiting] Hello?\nLORELAI: Hi, this is Phil's Liquor. I'm supposed to be delivering a keg there tonight.\nRORY: Hold on. [switches to other call] Hi, sorry. Yeah, that's it. Forty minutes, great. Bye. [switches back] Hey.\nLORELAI: Who was that?\nRORY: Sandeep's.\nLORELAI: Oh, you're ordering the Indian food?\nRORY: Yup.\nLORELAI: Good, enjoy. Can you burn the house down afterward, cause that's the only way we'll get the smell out.\nRORY: Absolutely. How's the spa?\nLORELAI: Tranquil.\nRORY: Really?\nLORELAI: I wasn't done. Tranquilizers, uh, will be required if I have to spend one more minute with my mother.\nRORY: Please tell me you're at least trying to get along with her?\nLORELAI: Oh, hey, I'm being a peach.\nRORY: Really?\nLORELAI: Well, I smell like a peach. Was that the doorbell?\nRORY: Yeah, I'll call you later.\nLORELAI: Oh wait, I wanna find out who it is.\nRORY: The sooner you get back to your weekend, the sooner it'll be over.\nLORELAI: Okay, but before you go, can you get out my address book and count how many friends I have? I'll wait.\nRORY: Bye.\nLORELAI: Mean!\nRORY: Steal me soap! [hangs up the phone, then opens the front door] Paris. What -.\nPARIS: I tried to stay home and study myself but I can't. I don't know what anything means anymore. I mean, I can't even read my own handwriting. What does this say? The person who wrote this should be dressed in a clown suit stuffing bodies under their porch. You're in your pajamas.\nRORY: I know.\nPARIS: This was the big night you had planned a rendezvous with Mr. Peanut?\nRORY: Well...\nPARIS: You're doing laundry.\nRORY: Yes.\nPARIS: You're doing laundry in your pajamas.\nRORY: My mom is out of town and I never get the house all to myself.\nPARIS: You mean you never get to go months on end without seeing your parents, just getting an occasional postcard that doesn't even have a courtesy \"Wish you were here\" written on it? That does suck. Don't let me stand in your way.\nRORY: Paris, wait.\nPARIS: No, forget it, I don't want to get in the way of your big night. I hear there's gonna be some hot knitting going on later.\nRORY: Fine, I'll study with you.\nPARIS: You will?\nRORY: For one hour, that's it. We can do a quick review and a pop quiz and then you are going home. Deal?\nPARIS: Deal.\nRORY: Okay, so, go sit on the couch. I'll be out in the minute.\nPARIS: Where are you going?\nRORY: I'm going to go change.\nPARIS: Okay, but my hour doesn't start until you get back out here, right?\nCUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA\n[Emily walks into Lorelai's room]\nEMILY: Are you ready?\nLORELAI: Wow, you look great, Mom.\nEMILY: Are you being sarcastic?\nLORELAI: No, I'm being completely serious.\nEMILY: Oh, well, thank you. That's a pretty color. What is that?\nLORELAI: It's called Vicious Trollop.\nEMILY: Oh, stop it! Now why would you name a lipstick something like that?\nLORELAI: Cause dirty whore' was taken?\nEMILY: You frighten me.\nLORELAI: You wanna try some?\nEMILY: No, thank you.\nLORELAI: Go on, Mom, try it.\nEMILY: It won't look good on me.\nLORELAI: Sure it will.\nEMILY: Well, all right, but if I look ridiculous. . .\nLORELAI: I'll be the first one to point it out. You're a vicious trollop, you're a vicious trollop.\nEMILY: Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Sorry.\nEMILY: Well?\nLORELAI: I like it.\nEMILY: You do? I like it too.\nLORELAI: Good, let's go then, I'm starving.\nEMILY: Oh, me too. What are they serving for dinner tonight?\nLORELAI: Well, let's see. [looks at menu] Hmm.\nEMILY: They certainly do like their tofu here, don't they?\nLORELAI: And the word steamed. Well, they have dessert at least. Cookies sweetened with sprouted mungbean.\nEMILY: That sounds dreadful.\nLORELAI: Yes, it does.\nEMILY: Where are you going? You aren't going to change, are you? Our seating's in ten minutes.\nLORELAI: Get your coat.\nEMILY: I don't need a coat to go to the dining room.\nLORELAI: We're not going to the dining room.\nEMILY: Well, where are we going?\nLORELAI: Out.\nEMILY: Out where?\nLORELAI: We're gonna leave the spa, find a restaurant, and have a steak.\nEMILY: A steak?\nLORELAI: Who's gonna stop us?\nEMILY: A steak.\nLORELAI: Come on, Mom. What's it gonna be vicious trollop or the wide world of mungbeans?\nEMILY: Let's go.\nLORELAI: I'm right behind you.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Rory and Paris are studying in the living room]\nRORY: So, given that those are the reactions occurring in the two half-cells, what do you do next?\nPARIS: Well, if we add them together, doubling the coefficients of the silver half equation but not the voltage, we get the equation for the complete reaction.\nRORY: Well, you're in much better shape than you wanna think you are.\nPARIS: Impossible. [doorbell rings; Rory walks toward the door] Where are you going?\nRORY: That's my food.\nPARIS: Another half hour, please!\nRORY: No, you got your hour. You need to go.\nPARIS: But .\nRORY: Go!\nPARIS: Fine.\n[Rory opens the door. Jess is holding a box of food]\nJESS: Delivery.\nRORY: What are you doing here?\nJESS: Well, Luke figured since you're along tonight that maybe you wouldn't have any food in the house, so he sent over a care package.\nRORY: I don't need a care package. I ordered food from Sandeep's.\nJESS: Really? Planning on burning down the house afterwards?\nRORY: Jess.\nJESS: The only way to k*ll the smell. Where should I put this? [walks into house]\nRORY: Well. . .\nJESS: Kitchen?\nRORY: Um. . .sure.\n[cut to kitchen]\nRORY: God, how much food is in there? This could feed twelve.\nJESS: Excuse me, I've seen you eat.\nRORY: Fine, six.\nJESS: Yeah, well, he wanted you taken care of. He wasn't sure how long your mom was gonna be gone for.\nRORY: Just tonight.\nJESS: Oh, he didn't know that.\nRORY: Well, now you can tell him.\nJESS: I will.\nRORY: So how come Caesar didn't bring this over?\nJESS: I volunteered.\nRORY: Why?\nJESS: Just wanted to get out of the construction zone. There's nothing but banging and yelling. That place gives me a headache.\nRORY: Oh.\nJESS: Why did you think I wanted to come over here and see you?\nRORY: No.\nJESS: Just needed some quiet.\nRORY: Fine.\nJESS: That is all.\nRORY: Got it.\nJESS: Clear my head.\nRORY: I understand.\nJESS: So, aren't you gonna eat?\nRORY: Eventually.\nJESS: It gets cold fast.\nRORY: I can heat it up.\nJESS: Reheated French fries really suck.\nRORY: Hm, they do suck.\nJESS: Yeah, so, eat.\nRORY: Okay, I will. You're still standing there.\nJESS: I know. You didn't give me a tip.\nRORY: You want money?\nJESS: No, I'll take a fry though.\nRORY: Okay, yeah, have as much as you want.\nJESS: Okay, great. [takes off jacket]\nRORY: What are you doing?\nJESS: Getting ready to eat.\nRORY: You're staying?\nJESS: Didn't you just invite me?\nRORY: No, I -.\nJESS: No, you told me to have all I wanted. That sounded invitation-like.\nRORY: You wanna stay here and eat?\nJESS: Beats being at Luke's.\nRORY: But .\nPARIS: [walks in from living room] I can't find my flashcards.\nJESS: I didn't know you had company.\nRORY: This is Paris. We were just studying.\nJESS: Huh.\nPARIS: Don't worry, I was just leaving. If you find my flashcards, call me, okay?\nRORY: No.\nPARIS: What?\nRORY: Stay for dinner.\nPARIS: But I thought. . .\nRORY: We have a ton of food, and we can go over the notes more later.\nPARIS: You're sure?\nRORY: Positive.\nPARIS: Is that mac and cheese?\nRORY: It sure is.\nPARIS: I love mac and cheese.\nRORY: Great.\nPARIS: I'm not allowed to have mac and cheese.\nRORY: Splurge. Come on Paris, stay.\nPARIS: Do you have a twenty-four hour pharmacy just in case I have an allergic reaction to something?\nRORY: Believe it or not, we do.\nPARIS: Okay, can I borrow your phone?\nRORY: It's by the door.\n[Paris walks away]\nJESS: Interesting.\nRORY: What is?\nJESS: You think we need a chaperone?\nRORY: No, I don't.\nJESS: You just invited one.\nRORY: I'm just being polite. Paris is alone tonight and you yourself just said we have enough food for six.\nJESS: With me around, it's down to four.\nRORY: With Paris around, it's down to two.\nJESS: Works out well.\nRORY: I think so.\nPARIS: [on phone] Hola, es Paris. Voy a comer la cena de cas de Rory. Hay mucho mac and cheese!\nCUT TO RESTAURANT\n[Emily and Lorelai check their coats, then walk toward the hostess]\nEMILY: My goodness, look at this place.\nLORELAI: I bet there's no cucumber slices in the water here. [to hostess] Hi there, party of two.\nHOSTESS: Okay. Uh, well, I can take your name, but I probably won't have a table for about an hour.\nLORELAI: An hour!\nEMILY: I can't wait an hour.\nLORELAI: Me either.\nEMILY: I'll pass out.\nLORELAI: Go first, you can break my fall.\nEMILY: Can we bribe you?\nHOSTESS: Sorry.\nLORELAI: Please? She's loaded.\nEMILY: Lorelai!\nHOSTESS: You know, a couple of stools just opened up at the bar, and we do serve our entire menu there.\nLORELAI: That is a great idea. Thanks. Come on.\nEMILY: We cannot eat dinner at a bar.\nLORELAI: I don't wanna wait an hour, and I'm wearing the wrong shoes for a drive thru.\nEMILY: But what are people going to think?\nLORELAI: That we're loose women with questionable morals.\n[they sit down at the bar]\nEMILY: Doesn't seem right to eat dinner when your feet aren't touching the floor.\nBARTENDER: What can I get you ladies?\nLORELAI: Hi Steve, nice to meet you. We will have two. . .martinis?\nEMILY: Why not?\nLORELAI: Two vodka martinis, straight up with a twist, very dry, very cold, and a couple of menus, please.\nEMILY: And some peanuts.\nLORELAI: Ah, peanuts, good idea.\nBARTENDER: Here you go, I'll get your drinks.\nLORELAI: Thank you. You're a good man, Steve. Okay, I'm thinking steak and Caesar salad if it's not too anchovy-y, and hey do you wanna split a shrimp cocktail to start?\nEMILY: That sounds fine.\nLORELAI: Ah, I just love the idea of shrimp cocktail with a steak dinner, you know? It's so Casino, Big Joe, steak and shrimp hey, save some for winter, there.\nEMILY: I never realized how wonderful peanuts were before.\nBARTENDER: Want a refill?\nEMILY: Oh, yes, please.\nLORELAI: Cheers, Mom.\nEMILY: Cheers. I must tell you, I never expected this.\nLORELAI: What?\nEMILY: Me inhaling peanuts at a singles bar.\nLORELAI: This isn't a singles bar, Mom. It's a sixty-forty bar.\nEMILY: A what?\nLORELAI: Sixty-year-old men hitting on forty-year-old women, divorcees mostly.\nEMILY: Really?\nLORELAI: Look around.\nEMILY: Hm. Oh, now, she can do better than that. What does she see in him?\nLORELAI: Big will, short life span, the usual draw. Hey Mom.\nEMILY: I wonder if they have pretzels, too.\nLORELAI: Don't look now, but I think you're passing for a forty-year-old woman.\nEMILY: What?\nLORELAI: Two o'clock, silver fox, totally checking you out.\nEMILY: Oh, he is not.\nLORELAI: Well, he's not staring at Steve.\nEMILY: You're being ridiculous. He's definitely not looking at me.\nLORELAI: He's still looking.\nEMILY: Drink your martini, Lorelai.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Rory, Paris, and Jess are eating at the kitchen table]\nPARIS: A tragic waste of paper.\nJESS: I can't believe you just said that.\nPARIS: Well, it's true, the Beat's writing was completely self-indulgent. I have one word for Jack Kerouac edit.\nJESS: It was not self-indulgent. The Beats believed in shocking people, stirring things up.\nPARIS: They believed in drugs, booze, and petty crime.\nRORY: Well, then you can say that they exposed you to a world you wouldn't have otherwise known. Isn't that what great writing's all about?\nPARIS: That was not great writing. That was the National Enquirer of the fifties.\nJESS: You're cracked.\nPARIS: Typical guy response. Worship Kerouac and Bukowski, God forbid you'd pick up anything by Jane Austen.\nJESS: Hey, I've read Jane Austen.\nPARIS: You have?\nJESS: Yeah, and I think she would've liked Bukowski.\nPARIS: What are you doing?\nJESS: Salt and pepper dip. Only way to eat a fry.\nPARIS: Really?\nRORY: It's fast food gospel.\nPARIS: Mm. That's good. That's really, really good.\n[phone rings]\nJESS: You like hot sauce?\nPARIS: I don't know. Should I?\nJESS: I think it's wise.\nRORY: [answers phone] Hello?\nDEAN: Hey.\nRORY: Oh, hey. Where are you?\nDEAN: On my way to see you if that's okay?\nRORY: Oh, well -\nDEAN: I know you wanna be alone, so I'll only stay a minute. I just wanna say hi.\nRORY: We just said hi.\nDEAN: Well, I wanna say hi a little closer.\nRORY: But, I'm a mess, really. It's not pretty. You won't recognize me.\nDEAN: Well, then put a name tag on cause I miss you.\nRORY: I miss you too, but\nDEAN: But what?\nRORY: But. . .Paris is here.\nDEAN: Why?\nRORY: She freaked out about a grade and she wanted to go over some notes, and you know Paris she will not be denied.\nDEAN: Okay, then I'm not really ruining your alone night, someone else did that.\nRORY: Yes, but\nDEAN: I'll see you in a sec. [hangs up]\nJESS: I can't get into poetry. It's kind of like, geez, just say it already, we're dying here.\nRORY: Wow, you know, I just noticed the time, and it's getting really late.\nJESS: It's seven o'clock.\nRORY: I know, but Paris and I still have a lot more studying to do. Jess, please thank Luke for me. It was really nice of him.\nJESS: Who was on the phone?\nRORY: No one.\nJESS: No one wouldn't happen to be heading over here now, would he?\nRORY: Jess.\nPARIS: What's going on?\nRORY: Nothing.\nJESS: Dean's on his way over and Rory doesn't want him to find me here.\nRORY: Why?\nJESS: Yeah, why?\nRORY: You know why.\nJESS: We're just eating dinner.\nRORY: Jess, I'm asking you as a friend, just please leave now.\nJESS: You really want me to go?\nRORY: I really wanna avoid a fight with Dean.\nJESS: Okay, I'm going.\nRORY: Thank you.\nJESS: Ow!\nRORY: What?\nJESS: Ooh! I just twisted my ankle. I better go lie down.\nRORY: Jess!\nJESS: God, you're no fun when you're tense. Are you sure you want me to go? Cause maybe this whole thing can be solved between me and Dean if we just sat down and had a little heart to heart. He can tell me his issues, I'll tell him mine.\nRORY: Jess!\nJESS: I promise I'll speak slowly.\nRORY: Bye! [pushes him out the front door]\nJESS: Okay, well, give him my best, would ya? [sees Dean in the front yard] Actually, I guess I could do that myself.\nRORY: Dean, Jess just came by to bring me some food.\nJESS: From Luke's.\nRORY: He wanted to make sure I ate.\nJESS: Luke did.\nRORY: Right, Luke did.\nJESS: Personally, I could care less if she eats.\nRORY: Yeah, true, he could care less.\nJESS: I see you brought a little something, too. Is that ice cream? That's so nice. A tiny little ice cream package just big enough for two. Hey, are you guys gonna feed each other cause that's just so darn cute. Oops. You're doing that towering over me thing. Huh. I tell you, you've really got that down. It helps that you're twelve feet tall, but this Frankenstein scowl really adds to the whole .\nRORY: Jess.\nJESS: Okay, I'm going. Look, man, I really was just dropping off some food, so don't get all West Side Story on me, okay? [leaves]\nRORY: So, do you wanna. . . [Dean walks into the house] . . .come in?\n[cut to kitchen]\nDEAN: What the hell is going on?\nPARIS: Hi.\nRORY: Dean, you remember Paris, right?\nDEAN: Yeah, hi. So Jess just dropped this off, huh?\nRORY: Oh, well. . .\nDEAN: Now I know you eat fast, but this is a lot of food to put away that quickly, even on your best day.\nRORY: Okay, so he didn't just drop it off but - .\nDEAN: You told me you were doing laundry tonight.\nRORY: I was.\nDEAN: And now you are here with Jess.\nRORY: And Paris!\nDEAN: Jess, Rory!\nRORY: Ah, well, I swear, I didn't\nDEAN: You didn't what? You didn't know he was coming over?\nRORY: I didn't.\nDEAN: And you also didn't know he was gonna stay, right?\nRORY: It just happened.\nDEAN: How does that just happen?\nRORY: Well, he was. . .and the diner, the diner was. . .and I. . .\nDEAN: And you what? What? Say something!\nRORY: Stop yelling!\nDEAN: You totally lied to me!\nRORY: I didn't!\nDEAN: Turn the situation around, Rory! How's it looking?\nRORY: It's looking complicated and I'm trying to explain it to you.\nDEAN: Ugh, that's crap.\nPARIS: It's my fault.\nDEAN: What?\nPARIS: It's my fault that Jess was here. I saw him in the diner the day I came to Stars Hollow and I thought he was cute and since I'm not great at the whole batting the eyelashes, look at my belly shirt' kind of thing, I asked Rory to help me. I thought if she could maybe get him over here, we'd have a chance to talk and. . .I don't know, it seems totally stupid now and it obviously didn't work shock, but that's why he was here. Thanks for trying to cover for me.\nRORY: That's okay.\nPARIS: Anyway, I should get going. I'm probably gonna break out in some sort of rash any second now. [leaves kitchen]\nDEAN: So Paris likes Jess?\nRORY: Yeah.\nDEAN: Rory, is this true?\nRORY: Yes it is.\nDEAN: Paris and Jess?\nRORY: I know. There's no explaining attraction. Dean, listen to me, if I was going to have anyone over tonight, it definitely would've been you.\nDEAN: Okay.\nRORY: Really?\nDEAN: Well, if you say so, then I have to believe it, don't I?\nRORY: Yes.\nDEAN: Well, okay then. I'm sorry that I yelled.\nRORY: Completely justified under the circumstances.\nDEAN: I'm gonna get going.\nRORY: No, wait, don't you wanna stay for ice cream? We could hang out.\nDEAN: Nah, I'm just gonna go.\nRORY: I'm still seeing you tomorrow, right?\nDEAN: Yeah, sure.\nRORY: Hey.\nDEAN: See you tomorrow. [leaves]\n[Rory walks into the living room]\nRORY: What was that?\nPARIS: What?\nRORY: That, the story, the save? You helped me. Why would you do that?\nPARIS: I don't know, it just came out.\nRORY: You have no idea what you did.\nPARIS: It was no big deal.\nRORY: No, it was a very big deal. It was a huge deal.\nPARIS: Well, you helped me tonight when you didn't want to, so I owed you.\nRORY: Thank you.\nPARIS: You're welcome. Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your alone night.\nRORY: You should stay.\nPARIS: Stay?\nRORY: Yeah. We could hang out, maybe watch some TV. You can even spend the night if you don't wanna drive all the way back to Hartford.\nPARIS: Spend the night, like a slumber party?\nRORY: Sort of.\nPARIS: You're just doing this because I lied to Dean for you, right?\nRORY: I'm doing this because it's what you do with friends.\nPARIS: We're friends?\nRORY: I'm not sure if there is an exact definition for what we are, but I do think it falls somewhere in the bizarro friends-ish realm. Come on, stay.\nPARIS: Okay. But if you're doing all this so you can freeze my bra, I'll k*ll you.\nRORY: Duly noted.\nCUT TO RESTAURANT\n[Lorelai and Emily are eating dinner.]\nEMILY: This is either the greatest steak I've ever eaten, or I'm so hungry, I'm delirious. Pass the horseradish, please.\nLORELAI: I never knew you were a spicy girl.\nEMILY: Oh, believe me, I can handle my heat. One summer when we were first married, your father and I stayed at this little village in Thailand where we spent two weeks eating viciously hot chilies and skinny-dipping.\nLORELAI: Ah, Mom!\nEMILY: Well, you certainly couldn't put your clothes on after eating those things.\nLORELAI: Stop it! I like to think of parents the old fashioned way separate bedrooms.\nFEMALE SINGER: And now it's time for my favorite part of the evening our salute to the Chairman of the Board.\nMALE SINGER: I sure hope that's not b-o-r-e-d.\nLORELAI: Uh, uh, Mom?\nEMILY: Yes?\nLORELAI: Remember the man who wasn't staring at you?\nEMILY: He wasn't staring at me.\nLORELAI: Okay, well, he's coming over.\nEMILY: What?\nCHAD: Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting, but I couldn't help but notice that you two are having more fun than anyone at the bar.\nLORELAI: Well, that's true, we are.\nCHAD: Well, good, I've come to the right place. Hi, I'm Chad.\nLORELAI: Hi Chad. I'm Lorelai. This is my mother, Emily.\nCHAD: Your mother?\nLORELAI: Chad, if the next words out of your mouth are, you can't possibly be old enough to be her mother,' I'm gonna have to cause you severe physical pain.\nCHAD: Emily, do you share this rather extreme opinion?\nEMILY: I think I'll stay out of it.\nCHAD: In that case, let me just say that I think you look more like sisters than mother and daughter. Yeah, I went for a variation.\nLORELAI: I'll let it slide this time.\nCHAD: So, are you two, uh, local or just visiting?\nLORELAI: Visiting. Mom's from Hartford and I'm from a town, uh\nCHAD: Hartford? Great town, great town. A little of the old, little of the new. You like living there?\nEMILY: Well, yes, I do.\nLORELAI: And how about you, Chad where do you live?\nCHAD: Here and by here, I mean this very bar stool.\nLORELAI: Wow, admitting right off the bat that you spend your life at a bar. Do you find that people are impressed by that?\nCHAD: Until now.\nEMILY: Oh, I love this song.\nCHAD: It's a great song for dancing.\nEMILY: Yes, it is.\nCHAD: Help me out here, will ya?\nLORELAI: I think he's asking you to dance, Mom.\nEMILY: What? Oh, no, I, uh, I couldn't.\nCHAD: Rumor has it you love this song.\nEMILY: Oh, well, yes, but I don't dance.\nCHAD: Oh, come on. I can't believe that.\nEMILY: And I shouldn't leave my daughter alone.\nLORELAI: That's okay. The sitter'll be here any minute.\nEMILY: Really, I'm serious, you should ask someone else.\nCHAD: Is it my dancing? Because you two could work out some kind of save me' signal in case I really embarrass you.\nLORELAI: Go ahead, Mom. It'll be fun.\nCHAD: Come on, the song's almost over. You'll hardly have to spend any time at all with me.\nEMILY: All right.\n[they start dancing]\nBARTENDER: Hey, your mom looks good out there.\nLORELAI: Yup, she sure does.\n[When the song ends, Emily starts to walk away but Chad pulls her closer for another dance. After a few seconds, Emily breaks away from him.]\nEMILY: I'm sorry, I have to go.\n[She quickly walks over to the coat check area. Lorelai gets up and follows her]\nLORELAI: Mom, what's wrong?\nEMILY: We're leaving.\nLORELAI: What happened?\nEMILY: I shouldn't have been doing this.\nLORELAI: Doing what?\nEMILY: Fraternizing with other men.\nLORELAI: Oh, what are you talking about?\nEMILY: I practically cheated on your father.\nLORELAI: You did not cheat on Dad.\nEMILY: I danced with another man.\nLORELAI: You've danced with other men before.\nEMILY: Not like that, not without your father present.\nLORELAI: Oh, Mom, it was just a dance. You were having fun.\nEMILY: I need to get out of here. How hard is it to find a coat?\nLORELAI: Mom, you didn't do anything wrong.\nEMILY: I don't know why I let you take me to this chop house in the first place. I don't go to chop houses. What were you thinking?\nLORELAI: Need food now.\nEMILY: And I certainly don't eat at bars. Hookers eat at bars.\nLORELAI: Only if they can't get a table.\nEMILY: You're not funny. You knew this whole evening made me uncomfortable and yet you kept pushing.\nLORELAI: I was trying to do everything right. You manipulated me into taking this trip and still I came. You told me I was acting like a teenager, so I tried to be nicer. You said you needed to eat, so I made that happen.\nEMILY: Yes, by sitting me at a bar where you practically forced me to engage in inappropriate behavior.\nLORELAI: What?\nEMILY: You let me get sixty-fortied!\nLORELAI: You are crazy! Do you know that? We were having dinner, Mom, a nice dinner. We were talking. Hell, we were having fun.\nEMILY: Oh, so watching your mother make an ass of herself was fun for you?\nLORELAI: God, you know, you don't have any right to complain about this relationship if you're not willing to let your guard down once in awhile and just be normal.\nEMILY: There's a way for a mother to behave in front of her daughter. I'm sorry if you don't like it, but that's how it is.\nCUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA\n[Lorelai is in her room, packing. There's a knock on the door.]\nLORELAI: Come in.\nEMILY: I called the bellman to get the bags. He said it would be around ten minutes.\nLORELAI: Okay.\nEMILY: Thank you for agreeing to leave early.\nLORELAI: No problem.\nEMILY: I guess this whole thing was a silly idea anyway. I don't know why I pushed it. We can't even get through a dinner without a fight. What was I thinking putting us together for a weekend?\nLORELAI: It was a nice thought, Mom.\nEMILY: Yes, well, I guess it's the thought that counts, isn't it?\nLORELAI: You know, if you want, um, I can just bring our bags down. I mean, they're not that heavy, and then we don't have to wait.\nEMILY: Well, that sounds fine. Why can't we have what you and Rory have?\nLORELAI: Rory and I are different mom.\nEMILY: We're mother and daughter, you're mother and daughter. It shouldn't be that different.\nLORELAI: It's completely different. It couldn't be more different.\nEMILY: But why?\nLORELAI: I grew up in a different environment.\nEMILY: You mean an oppressive environment.\nLORELAI: No, Mom, I mean a different environment. And plus, I was so young when I had Rory.\nEMILY: So because I waited until I was grown and married, I can't have a relationship with my daughter?\nLORELAI: No.\nEMILY: Well, then, why?\nLORELAI: Rory and I are best friends, Mom. We are best friends first and mother and daughter second, and you and I are mother and daughter always.\nEMILY: I wasn't taught to be best friends with my daughter.\nLORELAI: I know.\nEMILY: I was taught to be a role model for my daughter.\nLORELAI: I know that, too.\nEMILY: I did what I thought was right. I did what I thought I had to do to protect you, and because of this we have no relationship.\nLORELAI: Oh, Mom, we have a relationship.\nEMILY: We do? What? What is our relationship?\nLORELAI: Well, we. . .\nEMILY: Exactly.\nLORELAI: Maybe an intense weekend together was not the best idea for us. Maybe we need to start with something simpler.\nEMILY: Like what, a brisk walk around the block?\nLORELAI: No, I hate exercise.\nEMILY: Oh, well, as long as you find this amusing.\nLORELAI: Mom, come on. There has to be something else. Something small.\nEMILY: Like what? Where are you going? Lorelai, you just don't walk out on a person. That's rude. That's a robe.\nLORELAI: Yes, this is my robe. And I want you to go into your room and get your robe. And then, exactly at the same time, we are gonna shove these robes in our suitcases and we are gonna walk out that door and leave with them.\nEMILY: That's stealing.\nLORELAI: Yes, it is.\nEMILY: You want me to steal a robe? That's how we're going to bond?\nLORELAI: Mom, you love this robe. You've talked about nothing else except this robe since we got here, so this robe will be symbolic of our trip together.\nEMILY: But that's crazy. As soon as they check the rooms, they're going to know the robes are gone and then they're going to charge our credit card.\nLORELAI: Well, how do you know?\nEMILY: Because that's what the little tag on the hanger says.\nLORELAI: Well, the little tag on the hanger could be right, or the little tag on the hanger could just be there trying to scare us away from trying. Either way, whether we get away with it or not, it's something we did, you and I.\nEMILY: You're serious.\nLORELAI: I am folding this robe up.\nEMILY: Lorelai.\nLORELAI: I am putting this robe in my bag.\nEMILY: That's lunacy.\nLORELAI: I am zipping up the bag that contains the robe.\nEMILY: I have a perfectly good robe at home.\nLORELAI: Now the only question is, am I doing it alone?\nEMILY: Did you ever steal a robe with Rory?\nLORELAI: No, Rory would never steal. She's far too moral for that. You, however, vicious trollop what's it gonna be?\nEMILY: I should have my head examined.\nLORELAI: We'll make an appointment when we get back.\nEMILY: You do know, in the course of one night, you've turned me into an adulterer and a thief.\nLORELAI: I'll have you working at the chicken ranch by the end of the month.\nEMILY: I cannot believe I'm doing this.\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table.]\nRORY: You actually got Grandma to steal a bathrobe?\nLORELAI: Although I did catch her trying to return it while I was getting the car.\nRORY: Still.\nLORELAI: I know, life with my mother, one step forward, five thousand steps back. It's kinda like the spastic polka.\nKIRK: Excuse me, are you done?\nLORELAI: No, uh, sorry, not yet.\nKIRK: So, you're gonna eat that half a piece of bacon that's been sitting there for ten minutes?\nLORELAI: Kirk.\nKIRK: I mean, of course, you must be if you're saying you're not done because that's the only thing left in front on you, unless you eat plates.\nLORELAI: Go away.\nKIRK: You are hogging the table.\nLORELAI: You keep it up, I'm ordering seconds.\nKIRK: Fine.\nLORELAI: So, Paris looked a little green this morning.\nRORY: Yeah, she had a sugar/carb hangover of monumental proportions.\nLORELAI: People don't realize it, but it takes years of training to be able to eat the way we do.\nRORY: Don't I know it.\nLORELAI: So, what's on the agenda for today?\nRORY: Let's see. Dean, Dean, and uh. . .oh, did I mention Dean?\nLORELAI: Wow, he must've been crazy mad last night.\nRORY: I'd say that was a fair assessment.\nLORELAI: Okay, I gotta get to the inn.\nRORY: Okay. Well, I'm probably gonna have dinner with Dean, so. . .\nLORELAI: I'll have the house to myself tonight. Life's funny, isn't it?\nRORY: I simply cannot stop laughing. I'll get the check.\nLORELAI: Thanks hon.\nRORY: [walks to the counter] Hey Luke.\nLUKE: What, you find a nail in your food? I swear to God, Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!\nRORY: There's nothing wrong with the food, Luke.\nLUKE: Oh, sorry Tom.\nRORY: I just wanted to thank you.\nLUKE: Yeah, for what?\nRORY: For the care package. It was really sweet of you.\nLUKE: What care package?\nJESS: Hey Luke, I think they hit the water line again.\nLUKE: Oh, what? [walks away] Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!\nRORY: Huh, interesting.\nJESS: Hey, you wanna pay?\nRORY: I don't think Luke knew anything about the food last night.\nJESS: That'll be twelve-fifty.\nRORY: Which means you lied about why you came over.\nJESS: I don't have any quarters. I'm gonna have to give you nickels.\nRORY: Now why would you lie about something like that?\nJESS: Here's your change. Come again soon.\nRORY: You wanted to come over.\nJESS: I have to get back to work.\nRORY: You're squirming. I've never seen you squirm. It's entertaining.\nJESS: Oh yeah?\nRORY: Yeah.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai walks out of the diner. Dean is standing out front.]\nLORELAI: Dean, hey.\nDEAN: Hey.\nLORELAI: Rory's just inside paying. She's coming out to meet you after.\nDEAN: Yeah, we're gonna spend the day together.\nLORELAI: That's great.\nDEAN: Yeah, it is.\nLORELAI: So, listen, Rory told me everything that happened last night. She feels just terrible about it.\nDEAN: I know.\nLORELAI: Good, you should. It's just one of those freaky unfortunate things that happens.\nDEAN: Freaky and unfortunate, yeah.\nLORELAI: She had nothing to do with Jess coming over. Believe me, she did not want him there.\nDEAN: That's what she told me. And Rory wouldn't lie, right?\nLORELAI: No, Rory wouldn't lie.\nTHE END\nF.D. » Transcripts » G » Gilmore Girls","categories":[{"score":0.975,"name":"Business and Finance","id":"iabv2-52"},{"score":0.975,"name":"Business","id":"iabv2-53"},{"score":0.975,"name":"Small and Medium-sized Business","id":"iabv2-60"},{"score":0.858,"name":"Apparel Industry","id":"iabv2-113"},{"score":0.542,"name":"Funding","id":"diffbot-11"}]}]}{"request":{"pageUrl":"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=4935","api":"article","version":3},"objects":[{"date":"Sun, 26 May 2002 14:05:00 GMT","sentiment":0.463,"images":[{"naturalHeight":250,"width":0,"diffbotUri":"image|3|-1733677239","url":"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/images/logo250t.jpg","naturalWidth":250,"primary":true,"height":0}],"estimatedDate":"Sun, 26 May 2002 14:05:00 GMT","icon":"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/apple-touch-icon.png","diffbotUri":"article|3|-1923091289","siteName":"foreverdreaming.org","type":"article","title":"02x21 - Lorelai's Graduation Day","tags":[{"score":0.9915330410003662,"sentiment":0.682,"count":16,"label":"Lorelai Gilmore","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E8N18D-pZO_e6Cg0UkAeTrQ","rdfTypes":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Work"]},{"score":0.9642836451530457,"sentiment":0.511,"count":10,"label":"Rory Gilmore","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EArtTzn4cPnW-82y1yFLpCA","rdfTypes":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Work"]},{"score":0.9400752186775208,"sentiment":0,"count":1,"label":"Stars Hollow","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EWKAtAZl5PESn6LRoBModgw","rdfTypes":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Work"]},{"score":0.912693440914154,"sentiment":-0.467,"count":6,"label":"Samuel L.

It's cramped and girls are screaming and I think<\/p>\n<p>George is fighting with Ringo.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You have a very active head.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I simply cannot ingest anymore information.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So take a break.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't have time.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Close your eyes, clear your head.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, because clearing my head just means that all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out. In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff. It's a very vicious circle.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'll make some coffee.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I hate finals.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Nobody likes finals.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thank God I'm graduating and this is the last time I have to cram like this because my pursuit of higher education has led me to a very interesting discovery about myself. Do you wanna hear it?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Sure.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I despise academics. Yup, learning, knowledge, it's all worthless. I have no idea in what you see in any of it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Learning is fun, plus for me there's that whole &quot;I'm a minor so it's mandatory&quot; thing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's what kills me this is self-inflicted. I'm a masochist. I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile, trust me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I guess, unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hey, you're graduating.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, you're graduating there is gonna be a ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. It's community college.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, community colleges have ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: My community college doesn't even have a lawn, they won't necessarily have a ceremony<\/p>\n<p>RORY: They must. Did you ask?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No. Well, now that you mention it, I think someone said something about some cheesy ceremony for my business class.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: When is it?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know. . .next Thursday or something.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's great, you have to do it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You have to do it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Really?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes. You've never been apart of an actual graduation ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I know. That's because my stupid conservative high school wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Don't be gross.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Do you really think I should do it?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes! You've worked hard for this, you've earned it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I guess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Come on, you know that deep down you really want to do this.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, I'll admit, I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And the hat?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: For the tassel cause you know my thing for fringe.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And they call out your name and people clap and you get your diploma.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, and then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other very symbolic, very dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's it, you're doing it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: All right, if you insist.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, who do you wanna invite?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know, you.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That's cool with me.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Sookie and Jackson?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Aw, that'll be fun.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay. And Grandma and Grandpa?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, no. No no no.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Come on, it's your graduation. They should be there.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Forget it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: But --<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: They won't want to be there.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Of course they will.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school. Go to Vassar. Marry a Yale man and get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny or Shih Tzu.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes but --<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Instead, I got pregnant. I didn't finish high school, I didn't marry your father and I ended up in a career that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: That's not - .<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I humiliated them. The two proudest people in the world and I humiliated them. I spoiled their plans. I took their fine upbringing in a world of comfort and opportunity and I threw it in their faces. I broke their hearts and they'll never forgive me. I guess I can't expect them to.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Maybe you're wrong about how they feel about all this. It was a long time ago.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory, I don't want them to go. It'll just hurt them. . .and me, okay?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay. You should get back to your studying.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Fine. Oh, great.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I think I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, you haven't.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, I have. In fact, I may have forgotten everything that I've ever known.

There's two of you and the guy with the g*n yells &quot;Pull!&quot; and then the other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air and so you try to shoot it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I don't think we're missing anything.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Yeah, I knew it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You shoot pigeons?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Clay pigeons.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: When you hit them, does blood come out?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: They're clay.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And why do you like to do this?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I don't know. My dad shot skeet when he was my age and so he wants to pass the tradition down.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, does that count?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: That's never happened.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon, does that count?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, does that count?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: I've only done this once.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, if you get really good, do you move on to other animals like clay chickens and clay sheep?<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: You know, we didn't go skeet sh**ting, I just made it all up.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: [stops in front of the market] Oh, hey, I gotta go in here.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, what do you need?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Just general stuff. You guys go and be in love.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'll see you back at the house.<\/p>\n<p>DEAN: Bye.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What if you shoot the person who throws the pigeon up in the air?

So, tell me, what's this about? You were so mysterious on the phone.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I just wanted to talk to you about something in person.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, come in, come in.<\/p>\n<p>[Emily leads Rory to a lavishly set table.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Wow.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: It's an English tea service. One the advantages of our having an English maid. That, and the fact that she speaks English.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You didn't have to do this.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: But it's tea time and I wanted to. . .oh no! Beatrice, I told you to doily line the plates!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You don't have to doily line the plates.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: [calls from another room] Hello?<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We're in the dining room.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Oh, oh, Rory, you're already here.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're out of breath.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: I ran over from the office.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, you didn't have to run.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Well, your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us. That certainly justifies a run.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: All right, everybody, sit, sit. Pour the tea, Beatrice.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Um, actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on pouring the tea for just a minute? Thank you very much. Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you. Now, you can go for it or not, it's entirely up to you, but I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: We won't get upset.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And that you will try to keep an open mind.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: All right.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And that you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: [to Richard] She's been hanging around you far too much.<\/p>\n<p>RICHARD: Rory, we accept your terms. Please proceed.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Thank you. First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know that I'm here. She'd probably be pretty mad if she knew that I was, but I feel that this is important. As you know, Mom's been going to business school at the community college out here for three years now.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: I believe she's mentioned it.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, she's doing very well and she's finishing up. Actually, she's graduating Thursday, and there's going to be a ceremony and I think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there. It may not seem like it would, but it's true.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Well, if it would mean so much to her then why didn't she invite us herself?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Because she didn't think you'd wanna go. And I get that, but I think it's a mistake. I had a school thing once, and I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go so I didn't invite her. It was my kindergarten &quot;Salute to Vegetables&quot; pageant and I was broccoli and I did a tap dance with a guy that was playing beets and the entire number I was just thinking, &quot;Mom's not here&quot; and it was my fault that she wasn't there and, well, it was kind of a life lesson for me. Now, if the thought of going to Mom's graduation upsets you or makes you unhappy or uncomfortable in any way, then, please, don't go because this is an important night for Mom and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances. [pulls an envelope out of her backpack] Those are the tickets. It's Thursday, 7pm. It's indoors so weather's not an issue. You can use them or not, no hard feelings, do what you feel is best. And if you don't mind, I would really appreciate it if you would keep this conversation between the three of us. That's all I have to say, thanks very much for your patience. Now, I believe I have time for a scone before my bus leaves.<\/p>\n<p>EMILY: Beatrice, the tea, please.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Emily, these look delicious. So, Richard, how was your day today?<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[Lorelai is sitting on the coffee table with a drink as Rory reads on the sofa]<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I am feeling so good, sista, because it's over! No more finals, no more studying, no more school, the pressure's off. Do you know how much pressure I felt, do you? All last week I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: A giant man?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And his giant brother.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Did they have names?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Clem and Clem. Huh, same names, which did not reflect well on the imagination of their mothers.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mother.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Mothers. There were two Clems.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, cause they were brothers.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yes, so they had mothers.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, you're drawing me into your drunken world.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's not a bad place to be, my friend. Mnh-mnh, tank's empty. [walks into the kitchen to get another drink]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Hey, what is this?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: This, uh, Life Plan' book thing.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: A little gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College. Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Um, if you can't remember where the living room is.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ha ha, I'm still good. [walks back into living room]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, here's an interesting question for you &quot;Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?&quot;<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, well, uh, they're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure. I mean, I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock 'em out and, uh, have Nanny catch 'em and care for 'em, make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come anywhere near them and then just return them to me when they're twenty-one.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, what about me?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You are my favorite eldest child, you get to stay by my side.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Oh, I feel so privileged.<\/p>\n<p>[Phone rings]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'll get it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hey, now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up and blow that whistle I gave you.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: [answers phone] Hello?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Hi.

What about you?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Same.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: So, what have you been doing?<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Nothin' much.

I hope he's got it together now.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Sounds like you got a party going on there.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, it's just me and my mom.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna go. This is long distance.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, it is long distance.<\/p>\n<p>JESS: So, see ya.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, see ya.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[On Thursday morning, Rory is getting ready for school in the living room as Lorelai runs around upstairs.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Mom?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Ahh!<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What's wrong?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'm experiencing frustration.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: At the general state of things in the world or at something particular?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What do you wear to a graduation?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Cap and gown.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Duh, I mean underneath.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Whatever you want. The gown will cover it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It's more complicated than that. I don't want to overdress so that I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium but if I don't have enough on and it's cold, then I'll freeze.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It is complicated, especially if you overthink it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And now I need a helpful comment.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Take light layers. Wear your turquoise and tan dress that you just got that's cool and it'll look good without your gown on, and wear your turquoise vintagey sweater over it because it'll look great with the dress and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You are a fashion genius.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, you've taught me everything I know.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: My brain's not working today.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're excited, it's a big day.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What time are you getting there?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I have a bunch of newspaper stuff after school, but no later than six.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: And then we'll go out to eat after?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Any place you want, and it's on me.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You don't have to do that.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: You're the graduate.

I said I'm not taking AP calculus from Henemen. I'm going with Branch. Branch is a graduate of MIT and Henemen went to Berkley. Berkley! I mean, he may have majored in math but what did he minor in? Bean sprouts? Forget it. And I'm telling my advisor all this, Mrs. Schlosser, and I looked down in her trash can and there's this half-eaten banana in there. Nothing else. And I pictured her sitting in the shoe box of an office eating a banana all by herself and I almost felt sorry for her, but then she questioned my judgment about Berkley so I eviscerated her. I mean, she was welling up at the end, but she had the decency to hold it in until I was gone. I have enough faculty recommendations to run for student council, so I don't need her anyway.

Thanks for coming, Sook, Marcus Schenkenberg.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: You wanna go out to eat? Celebrate a little?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, I think I'll just go home to Rory.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: I thought so. See you tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Thanks.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: Wait a minute. . .aspirins instead of Jordan Almonds? But we already bought the almonds.<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Wow. Now that's the longest anything's ever taken.<\/p>\n<p>JACKSON: My family's not gonna get the joke. Can't we just use the almonds?<\/p>\n<p>SOOKIE: Okay, sweetie, calm down.<\/p>\n<p>CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE<\/p>\n<p>[Rory is waiting out front as Lorelai pulls into the driveway.]<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm so, so sorry.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You're okay, right?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Everything's working? Your wrist is okay, nothing new is broken?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm fine.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Anyone you know, like Lane or someone, suddenly get sick today or break an arm themselves or get in a car wreck?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, good. Then I can get past worry and move onto other things.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know you're hurt.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Yeah, you bet I'm hurt. Rory, I really wanted you there today, more than anything. You're why I did this stupid thing in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: It was a once in a lifetime thing. You should've been there. My best friend should've been there. Whatever it was that kept you, you should've gotten out of it, at least this once. Was it school?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It wasn't school.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Was it Paris?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It wasn't Paris.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, what was it?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It was so stupid.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, Rory, where were you? What happened?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I cut school!<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You what?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I cut school and I got on a bus and I don't even know why I did it. I. . .I have no excuse. I was just standing outside of Chilton, and I don't know, I must have had a stroke or something. What does a stroke feel like?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I don't know. Not good, probably.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And I left school and I got on a bus and I went to New York. And that's it! I'm grounded for six months, or seven, and no TV, no stereo, no reading. In fact, take all of my books away from me and lock them up.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hold on here. You went to New York?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: And no magazines, either. And I'm going to do all of the housework. Laundry, dishes. . . in fact, we're going to start eating at home so that we have dishes.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: What?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Stop. Why did you go to New York?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: To see Jess.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Boy, do you know how to bury the lead.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I don't know what happened.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You went to New York to see Jess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It was the stroke! It made me someone else, and after his phone call last night -<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: That was him?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It did something to me, I don't know what. In fact, you should take the phone away from me, too. That's right, add it to the list. No books, no music, no phone.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, Rory. . .<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm a horrible person.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You're not a horrible person.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I am sick, I'm ill, I'm cracked. This is not who I am. If I were to write this down in my diary and I would read it, I would be like, Who is this freak? This isn't me. This isn't my diary. I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't skip school when I have finals coming up to go see a guy that isn't even my guy and end up missing my mother's graduation, which I wanted to be at so badly. That's someone else. That's someone flighty and stupid and dumb and girly. And, I mean, I missed your graduation, which is the worst thing I could have possibly done. I mean, I hurt you and I had to spend hours on a stinky bus next to a guy that was spitting into a can, just thinking about all of the minutes that were going by that I wasn't at your graduation and they were hurting you, and they should have been hurting you because it was so selfish of this person who wasn't me to do what she did.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, my God, take a breath.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I don't deserve a breath. No breaths. You should add that to the list. You should beat me, ground me, take the phone away and deprive me of air.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, look, nobody wants to say this any less than me, but I - maybe you don't have a medical condition or a mental problem. Maybe, honey, you are falling for Jess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well -<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No, I love Dean. Dean is my boyfriend. He will always be my boyfriend. That's it. Forever.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, maybe not forever.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yes, forever. I love Dean and Jess is gone now and everything's going to be good again. Everything's going to be all right.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Rory, you cut school.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Yeah, I know.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: You got on a bus and went to a strange city in your uniform to see Jess.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I know.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Well, that doesn't mean nothing. That means something. I mean--<\/p>\n<p>RORY: No! I don't want to talk about this anymore. The only thing I want to talk about is the list I made on the bus of all the ways I'm gonna make this up to you. You get total control over the remote and the stereo for as long as you want. Total control over takeout food choices and a special surprise present every day for a month and -- oh my God! I left your present on the bus.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: What present?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: It was a vinyl copy of The Go-Gos original album and it was signed by Belinda, but it's not the only copy and I'm gonna find another copy. That's going on the list, too.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Okay, honey, please. Forget about the list until tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, I'll just go to bed then and...I'll go to my room.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Hold on one second. Does this mean I have to eat alone?<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Well, it's up to you. Sending me to bed without supper, you can't lose with that punishment. It's a classic.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: I'd rather go out with my daughter tonight.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I don't deserve it.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: No, but I do.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: Okay, just let me take a shower and get the horrible smell of this horrible day off of me, and then we'll go anywhere you want, my treat, and I won't enjoy it. And then we'll come home and I'll go straight to bed and I'll have a terrible night's sleep, okay?<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Sounds great.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I'm so, so sorry, Mom.<\/p>\n<p>LORELAI: Oh, really? 'Cause you didn't make that clear.<\/p>\n<p>RORY: I won't be long.<\/p>\n<p>THE END<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"javascript:var handle=window.open('http://foreverdreaming.org/')\">F.D.<\/a><b> &raquo; <\/b><a href=\"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/index.php?sid=eeb2c6f5386295dc7ab98a69fa8e509c\">Transcripts<\/a><b> &raquo; <\/b><a href=\"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=503&sid=eeb2c6f5386295dc7ab98a69fa8e509c\">G<\/a><b> &raquo; <\/b><a href=\"https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=22&sid=eeb2c6f5386295dc7ab98a69fa8e509c\">Gilmore Girls<\/a><\/p>","text":"2.21 - Lorelai's Graduation Day\nwritten by Daniel Palladino\ndirected by Jamie Babbit\nOPEN IN STARS HOLLOW\n[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]\nRORY: Where is this place?\nLORELAI: It's not too far.\nRORY: You've been saying that for miles.\nLORELAI: It has not been miles.\nRORY: My feet are sore.\nLORELAI: Hey, Tonto, when did you become older than me?\nRORY: Just tell me what this new breakfast place is and then I'll be quiet.\nLORELAI: It's an amazing new mystery place that I found and that's all I'm telling ya.\nRORY: Just tell me if it's in this town or the next.\nLORELAI: We don't patronize the next town.\nRORY: Since when?\nLORELAI: I don't know, didn't they feed lead to our jumping frog or something?\nRORY: Oh yeah, right after they stoned the woman who won the lottery.\nLORELAI: See, so the boycott's legit.\nLANE: [runs up behind them] Hey, wait, stop!\nLORELAI: Oh look, it's Michael Landon.\nLANE: Oh my God, you guys walk fast. I've been chasing you for the past two blocks.\nRORY: Hey, we were being followed.\nLORELAI: I told you I wasn't just being paranoid. Maybe next time you'll take me seriously when I tell you furniture moved itself.\nLANE: Where are you guys going?\nRORY: Mystery breakfast.\nLANE: Out of town?\nLORELAI: Does no one remember the definition of the word mystery?\nLANE: Sorry, I was just wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again this morning?\nLORELAI: It's not like they have any other use.\nLANE: Thanks. I've almost nailed the fill in the Ramble On. I just have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull my arms back.\nRORY: John Bonham had that same problem.\nLORELAI: Key's in the turtle.\nLANE: Enjoy your mystery breakfast. [walks away]\nLORELAI: Come on, it's not much farther.\nRORY: We're not heading toward any businesses of any kind. [Lorelai stops walking] What?\nLORELAI: We have arrived.\nRORY: Arrived where? [looks up] Aw, you are without shame.\nCUT TO INSIDE SOOKIE'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the table as Sookie serves them breakfast]\nRORY: Sookie, you do not have to do this.\nSOOKIE: What do you mean? Feeding my girls, making them happy, I love doing this.\nLORELAI: Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt.\nRORY: It makes me feel guilty.\nLORELAI: Eating can help drown that.\nSOOKIE: Yeah, yeah, eat, eat. I'm gonna eat.\nRORY: Gee, can the help sit at the table too?\nLORELAI: As long as they don't sing folk songs or tell bawdy stories. Hey, what's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?\n[Jackson, who is leaning against the counter with his eyes closed, moans]\nSOOKIE: He's not much of a morning person.\n[Jackson moans]\nLORELAI: Now say, I can't believe I ate the whole thing.'\nSOOKIE: It takes him about an hour to become Jackson.\n[Jackson moans]\nLORELAI: Ooh, hey, I had a good idea for the wedding.\nSOOKIE: Cool.\nLORELAI: Instead of those little wrapped things with Jordan Almonds at every place setting, what if we wrap up a few aspirin?\nSOOKIE: Aspirin?\nLORELAI: For the morning after hangovers.\nSOOKIE: That's funny.\nLORELAI: Cause Jordan Almonds are so done. Huh, Jackson what do you think aspirin over almonds?\n[Jackson moans.]\nLORELAI: Can we take that as a yes?\nSOOKIE: No. See, everything eventually registers. He'll chime in on this in a couple of days.\nRORY: Days?\nSOOKIE: Days.\nLORELAI: Hey, is Jackson in the house? Let me here you say unh.\nJACKSON: Unh.\nLORELAI: A new toy.\nRORY: Shameless.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai is studying at the kitchen table as Rory walks out of her bedroom]\nRORY: How's it going?\nLORELAI: I hate these books, hate them.\nRORY: Now now.\nLORELAI: Agh! See that? They're trying to escape they hate me, too.\nRORY: Your books don't hate you.\nLORELAI: Ugh, Rory, my brain is full. It has reached capacity. It's Shea Stadium when the Beatles played. It's cramped and girls are screaming and I think\nGeorge is fighting with Ringo.\nRORY: You have a very active head.\nLORELAI: I simply cannot ingest anymore information.\nRORY: So take a break.\nLORELAI: I don't have time.\nRORY: Close your eyes, clear your head.\nLORELAI: No, because clearing my head just means that all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out. In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff. It's a very vicious circle.\nRORY: I'll make some coffee.\nLORELAI: I hate finals.\nRORY: Nobody likes finals.\nLORELAI: Thank God I'm graduating and this is the last time I have to cram like this because my pursuit of higher education has led me to a very interesting discovery about myself. Do you wanna hear it?\nRORY: Sure.\nLORELAI: I despise academics. Yup, learning, knowledge, it's all worthless. I have no idea in what you see in any of it.\nRORY: Learning is fun, plus for me there's that whole \"I'm a minor so it's mandatory\" thing.\nLORELAI: That's what kills me this is self-inflicted. I'm a masochist. I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it.\nRORY: That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile, trust me.\nLORELAI: I guess, unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people.\nRORY: Hey, you're graduating.\nLORELAI: I know.\nRORY: No, you're graduating there is gonna be a ceremony.\nLORELAI: Oh, I don't know. It's community college.\nRORY: Well, community colleges have ceremonies.\nLORELAI: My community college doesn't even have a lawn, they won't necessarily have a ceremony\nRORY: They must. Did you ask?\nLORELAI: No. Well, now that you mention it, I think someone said something about some cheesy ceremony for my business class.\nRORY: When is it?\nLORELAI: I don't know. . .next Thursday or something.\nRORY: That's great, you have to do it.\nLORELAI: I don't know.\nRORY: You have to do it.\nLORELAI: Really?\nRORY: Yes. You've never been apart of an actual graduation ceremony.\nLORELAI: I know. That's because my stupid conservative high school wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.\nRORY: Don't be gross.\nLORELAI: Do you really think I should do it?\nRORY: Yes! You've worked hard for this, you've earned it.\nLORELAI: I guess.\nRORY: Come on, you know that deep down you really want to do this.\nLORELAI: Well, I'll admit, I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.\nRORY: And the hat?\nLORELAI: For the tassel cause you know my thing for fringe.\nRORY: And they call out your name and people clap and you get your diploma.\nLORELAI: Oh, and then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other very symbolic, very dramatic.\nRORY: That's it, you're doing it.\nLORELAI: All right, if you insist.\nRORY: Okay, who do you wanna invite?\nLORELAI: I don't know, you.\nRORY: And?\nLORELAI: That's cool with me.\nRORY: Sookie and Jackson?\nLORELAI: Aw, that'll be fun.\nRORY: Okay. And Grandma and Grandpa?\nLORELAI: Oh, no. No no no.\nRORY: Come on, it's your graduation. They should be there.\nLORELAI: Forget it.\nRORY: But --\nLORELAI: They won't want to be there.\nRORY: Of course they will.\nLORELAI: Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school. Go to Vassar. Marry a Yale man and get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny or Shih Tzu.\nRORY: Yes but --\nLORELAI: Instead, I got pregnant. I didn't finish high school, I didn't marry your father and I ended up in a career that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her.\nRORY: That's not - .\nLORELAI: I humiliated them. The two proudest people in the world and I humiliated them. I spoiled their plans. I took their fine upbringing in a world of comfort and opportunity and I threw it in their faces. I broke their hearts and they'll never forgive me. I guess I can't expect them to.\nRORY: Maybe you're wrong about how they feel about all this. It was a long time ago.\nLORELAI: Rory, I don't want them to go. It'll just hurt them. . .and me, okay?\nRORY: Okay. You should get back to your studying.\nLORELAI: Fine. Oh, great.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: I think I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.\nRORY: No, you haven't.\nLORELAI: Yes, I have. In fact, I may have forgotten everything that I've ever known. Child, what be your name?\nRORY: Study.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai, Rory, and Dean are walking through the center of town]\nLORELAI: Just explain the concept one more time.\nDEAN: And be mocked again? No, thank you.\nRORY: Come on.\nLORELAI: Yeah, maybe we're missing something.\nDEAN: Okay, you go to a special sh**ting range\nRORY: A skeet sh**ting range.\nDEAN: Right. There's two of you and the guy with the g*n yells \"Pull!\" and then the other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air and so you try to shoot it.\nLORELAI: No, I don't think we're missing anything.\nDEAN: Yeah, I knew it.\nRORY: You shoot pigeons?\nDEAN: Clay pigeons.\nLORELAI: When you hit them, does blood come out?\nDEAN: They're clay.\nRORY: And why do you like to do this?\nDEAN: I don't know. My dad shot skeet when he was my age and so he wants to pass the tradition down.\nLORELAI: What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?\nRORY: Yeah, does that count?\nDEAN: That's never happened.\nLORELAI: What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon, does that count?\nRORY: Yeah, does that count?\nDEAN: I've only done this once.\nLORELAI: Hey, if you get really good, do you move on to other animals like clay chickens and clay sheep?\nDEAN: You know, we didn't go skeet sh**ting, I just made it all up.\nLORELAI: [stops in front of the market] Oh, hey, I gotta go in here.\nRORY: Oh, what do you need?\nLORELAI: Just general stuff. You guys go and be in love.\nRORY: I'll see you back at the house.\nDEAN: Bye.\nRORY: What if you shoot the person who throws the pigeon up in the air? Would that count?\nCUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET\n[Lorelai is shopping and runs into Luke.]\nLUKE: Oh.\nLORELAI: Dah.\nLUKE: Sorry.\nLORELAI: No, no, I should have signaled or honked or something, my fault.\nLUKE: Okay.\nLORELAI: Well, um, I guess it was inevitable us running into each other. It's a very tiny community.\nLUKE: Guess so.\nLORELAI: How's the diner?\nLUKE: It's still there.\nLORELAI: Yes, I knew that. I'm able to empirically with my eyes, uh. . .Hey Luke, do you think we could\nLUKE: I gotta get back.\nLORELAI: Okay, right, right.\nCUT TO INSIDE THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[The doorbell rings]\nEMILY: I'll get it.\n[Emily opens the door]\nRORY: Hi Grandma.\nEMILY: Hello Rory.\nRORY: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.\nEMILY: I'm thrilled to see you on no notice. So, tell me, what's this about? You were so mysterious on the phone.\nRORY: I just wanted to talk to you about something in person.\nEMILY: Well, come in, come in.\n[Emily leads Rory to a lavishly set table.]\nRORY: Wow.\nEMILY: It's an English tea service. One the advantages of our having an English maid. That, and the fact that she speaks English.\nRORY: You didn't have to do this.\nEMILY: But it's tea time and I wanted to. . .oh no! Beatrice, I told you to doily line the plates!\nRORY: You don't have to doily line the plates.\nRICHARD: [calls from another room] Hello?\nEMILY: We're in the dining room.\nRICHARD: Oh, oh, Rory, you're already here.\nRORY: You're out of breath.\nRICHARD: I ran over from the office.\nRORY: Oh, you didn't have to run.\nRICHARD: Well, your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us. That certainly justifies a run.\nEMILY: All right, everybody, sit, sit. Pour the tea, Beatrice.\nRORY: Um, actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on pouring the tea for just a minute? Thank you very much. Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you. Now, you can go for it or not, it's entirely up to you, but I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.\nEMILY: We won't get upset.\nRORY: And that you will try to keep an open mind.\nEMILY: All right.\nRORY: And that you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.\nEMILY: [to Richard] She's been hanging around you far too much.\nRICHARD: Rory, we accept your terms. Please proceed.\nRORY: Thank you. First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know that I'm here. She'd probably be pretty mad if she knew that I was, but I feel that this is important. As you know, Mom's been going to business school at the community college out here for three years now.\nEMILY: I believe she's mentioned it.\nRORY: Well, she's doing very well and she's finishing up. Actually, she's graduating Thursday, and there's going to be a ceremony and I think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there. It may not seem like it would, but it's true.\nEMILY: Well, if it would mean so much to her then why didn't she invite us herself?\nRORY: Because she didn't think you'd wanna go. And I get that, but I think it's a mistake. I had a school thing once, and I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go so I didn't invite her. It was my kindergarten \"Salute to Vegetables\" pageant and I was broccoli and I did a tap dance with a guy that was playing beets and the entire number I was just thinking, \"Mom's not here\" and it was my fault that she wasn't there and, well, it was kind of a life lesson for me. Now, if the thought of going to Mom's graduation upsets you or makes you unhappy or uncomfortable in any way, then, please, don't go because this is an important night for Mom and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances. [pulls an envelope out of her backpack] Those are the tickets. It's Thursday, 7pm. It's indoors so weather's not an issue. You can use them or not, no hard feelings, do what you feel is best. And if you don't mind, I would really appreciate it if you would keep this conversation between the three of us. That's all I have to say, thanks very much for your patience. Now, I believe I have time for a scone before my bus leaves.\nEMILY: Beatrice, the tea, please.\nRORY: Emily, these look delicious. So, Richard, how was your day today?\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai is sitting on the coffee table with a drink as Rory reads on the sofa]\nLORELAI: I am feeling so good, sista, because it's over! No more finals, no more studying, no more school, the pressure's off. Do you know how much pressure I felt, do you? All last week I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest.\nRORY: A giant man?\nLORELAI: And his giant brother.\nRORY: Did they have names?\nLORELAI: Clem and Clem. Huh, same names, which did not reflect well on the imagination of their mothers.\nRORY: Mother.\nLORELAI: Mothers. There were two Clems.\nRORY: Yeah, cause they were brothers.\nLORELAI: Yes, so they had mothers.\nRORY: Okay, you're drawing me into your drunken world.\nLORELAI: It's not a bad place to be, my friend. Mnh-mnh, tank's empty. [walks into the kitchen to get another drink]\nRORY: Hey, what is this?\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: This, uh, Life Plan' book thing.\nLORELAI: A little gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College. Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?\nRORY: Um, if you can't remember where the living room is.\nLORELAI: Ha ha, I'm still good. [walks back into living room]\nRORY: Okay, here's an interesting question for you \"Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?\"\nLORELAI: Oh, well, uh, they're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure. I mean, I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock 'em out and, uh, have Nanny catch 'em and care for 'em, make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come anywhere near them and then just return them to me when they're twenty-one.\nRORY: Well, what about me?\nLORELAI: You are my favorite eldest child, you get to stay by my side.\nRORY: Oh, I feel so privileged.\n[Phone rings]\nRORY: I'll get it.\nLORELAI: Hey, now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up and blow that whistle I gave you.\nRORY: [answers phone] Hello?\nJESS: Hi. [pause] Hello?\nRORY: Hi.\nJESS: Is this a bad time?\nRORY: Um, no, just hold on a sec? [to Lorelai] Um, the music. . . uh, I'll be right back. [Rory takes the phone to her room and closes the door.] Hi.\nJESS: You said that already.\nRORY: I did. You're right, sorry.\nJESS: So, what's up?\nRORY: Nothing. What about you?\nJESS: Same.\nRORY: So, what have you been doing?\nJESS: Nothin' much. Just hanging out. . . in the park, mostly.\nRORY: Central Park?\nJESS: Washington Square Park.\nRORY: Oh.\nJESS: It's cooler.\nRORY: Yes.\nJESS: It's where David Lee Roth got busted.\nRORY: Right, right. I hope he's got it together now.\nJESS: Sounds like you got a party going on there.\nRORY: No, it's just me and my mom.\nJESS: Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna go. This is long distance.\nRORY: Yeah, it is long distance.\nJESS: So, see ya.\nRORY: Yeah, see ya.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[On Thursday morning, Rory is getting ready for school in the living room as Lorelai runs around upstairs.]\nRORY: Mom?\nLORELAI: Ahh!\nRORY: What's wrong?\nLORELAI: I'm experiencing frustration.\nRORY: At the general state of things in the world or at something particular?\nLORELAI: What do you wear to a graduation?\nRORY: Cap and gown.\nLORELAI: Duh, I mean underneath.\nRORY: Whatever you want. The gown will cover it.\nLORELAI: It's more complicated than that. I don't want to overdress so that I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium but if I don't have enough on and it's cold, then I'll freeze.\nRORY: It is complicated, especially if you overthink it.\nLORELAI: And now I need a helpful comment.\nRORY: Take light layers. Wear your turquoise and tan dress that you just got that's cool and it'll look good without your gown on, and wear your turquoise vintagey sweater over it because it'll look great with the dress and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.\nLORELAI: You are a fashion genius.\nRORY: Well, you've taught me everything I know.\nLORELAI: My brain's not working today.\nRORY: You're excited, it's a big day.\nLORELAI: What time are you getting there?\nRORY: I have a bunch of newspaper stuff after school, but no later than six.\nLORELAI: And then we'll go out to eat after?\nRORY: Any place you want, and it's on me.\nLORELAI: You don't have to do that.\nRORY: You're the graduate. You get to be pampered.\nLORELAI: Okay, then I would like to go to Chateau Jean Georges la Jean Georges in Paris.\nRORY: I'll look it up in Zagats and book the Concorde. I gotta go.\nLORELAI: Okay, I gotta get ready.\nRORY: Wait, wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event.\nLORELAI: What do you think do I look ready to make my way in the world?\nRORY: Yes, and if all else fails, you can marry rich.\nLORELAI: I love that we always have that option.\nRORY: Hey, what are you gonna do with your hair?\nLORELAI: I got the curling iron warming up.\nRORY: Mom, the cap! You put it on, its gonna --\nBOTH: - smush the curls down.\nLORELAI: You are a genius.\nRORY: See you tonight\nLORELAI: Hey, try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or Screech or someone.\nRORY: I'll try.\nCUT TO FRONT OF CHILTON\n[Rory is walking with Paris]\nPARIS: So I told her, \"Look missy--\"\nRORY: You called your advisor \"Missy\"?\nPARIS: It was attitudinal. I said I'm not taking AP calculus from Henemen. I'm going with Branch. Branch is a graduate of MIT and Henemen went to Berkley. Berkley! I mean, he may have majored in math but what did he minor in? Bean sprouts? Forget it. And I'm telling my advisor all this, Mrs. Schlosser, and I looked down in her trash can and there's this half-eaten banana in there. Nothing else. And I pictured her sitting in the shoe box of an office eating a banana all by herself and I almost felt sorry for her, but then she questioned my judgment about Berkley so I eviscerated her. I mean, she was welling up at the end, but she had the decency to hold it in until I was gone. I have enough faculty recommendations to run for student council, so I don't need her anyway. My locker's this way.\n[As Paris walks toward the building, Rory turns and goes back out the gates.]\nCUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN\n[Sookie carries a cake into the room as Lorelai sits at the counter with her eyes closed]\nSOOKIE: Are they closed?\nLORELAI: They're closed.\nSOOKIE: Are you sure?\nLORELAI: I'm sure.\nSOOKIE: Okay, one second and open, open, open.\nLORELAI: Aw, you made me a tassel hat cake!\nSOOKIE: Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans.\nLORELAI: You're evil.\nSOOKIE: And you're graduating.\nLORELAI: Yes I am, aren't I?\nSOOKIE: Here. Oh, hey, I brought those pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation.\nLORELAI: Hand them over, lady.\nSOOKIE: Okay, but don't laugh.\nLORELAI: I promise.\nSOOKIE: I was younger then, not as refined.\nLORELAI: Ha, and you're stoned.\nSOOKIE: Totally.\nLORELAI: I thought you hated that.\nSOOKIE: It was peer pressure. At my school, if Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off.\nLORELAI: Well, I think Gilbert had a snappy slogan.\nSOOKIE: Oh, I was nauseous all day.\nLORELAI: Your parents?\nSOOKIE: For the traditional parents-flanking-their-graduate shot. Don't they look proud?\nLORELAI: They do, very proud.\n[Michel walks into the kitchen]\nMICHEL: What is that?\nLORELAI: Oh, it's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation. What was your high school graduation like, Michel?\nMICHEL: It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are. Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed.\nLORELAI: You drank some Boone's Farm out of a boda bag and knocked a beach ball around?\nMICHEL: I don't understand half of what you said.\nLORELAI: That's why we work.\n[Cell phone rings.]\nLORELAI: [answers] Hello?\nCHRISTOPHER: Hey, Lor, how you doing?\nLORELAI: Christopher. I'm good, I'm excited.\nCHRISTOPHER: You should be, it's a big day. Did you get my present?\nLORELAI: What present?\nCHRISTOPHER: A basket. You should've gotten it by now.\nLORELAI: Hey, did a basket come for me?\nMICHEL: Mm, it came, it was heavy, I felt a twinge so I dropped it for health reasons. It's probably still intact.\nLORELAI: My crack staff has just informed me of its arrival. I'm going to find it. [walks into the lobby and sees the basket on a table] Wow!\nCHRISTOPHER: I put it together myself.\nLORELAI: And it's all for me?\nCHRISTOPHER: All for you.\nLORELAI: Chris. . wow. [starts looking through the basket] Ha! A twenty-five dollar savings bond.\nCHRISTOPHER: That's a long-term investment. Don't touch it for thirty years, you're looking at forty-five dollars.\nLORELAI: Ooh, a youth hostel card.\nCHRISTOPHER: For the young girl who doesn't mind sharing a bathroom with fifty strangers.\nLORELAI: \"What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job Hunters.\"\nCHRISTOPHER: Helping you answer the two questions: what do you want to do and where do you want to do it?\nLORELAI: A DVD of The Graduate, gotta have that. Ooh, The Portable Nietzsche.\nCHRISTOPHER: Light, cheery reading.\nLORELAI: An application to join the Armed Forces.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, if your dreams don't pan out and Nietzsche's no help, it's a viable option.\nLORELAI: And something in a nice little velvet box. Ooh, a necklace, and the pearl almost looks real.\nCHRISTOPHER: Well, it better look very real, because it is.\nLORELAI: That's not funny.\nCHRISTOPHER: This is not a funny gift.\nLORELAI: Christopher, this is extremely not funny. This is totally humorless. It's. . .it's beautiful.\nCHRISTOPHER: I think you're awesome, Lor. With everything you do and raising Rory the way you did, you're superwoman.\nLORELAI: Wow.\nCHRISTOPHER: Have a great day. I wish I could be there. Take lots of pictures for me.\nLORELAI: Ugh, the camera, I forgot the camera.\nCHRISTOPHER: Look in the basket.\nLORELAI: [pulls out a disposable camera] Oh, you thought of everything.\nCHRISTOPHER: Have a great night.\nLORELAI: Thanks, you too. Bye.\nCUT TO BUS STATION\n[Rory gets off the bus and looks around. She walks out of the station and onto the crowded sidewalk.]\nRORY: Could you. . .um, excuse me, sir, do you know. . . do you know where Washington. . .excuse me, ma'am. . .Washington Square Park?\nWOMAN: End of Fifth.\nRORY: Thank you! [to someone else] Excuse me, where's Fifth?\nCUT TO WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK\n[Jess is reading on a bench as Rory walks up behind him]\nRORY: Hi.\nJESS: How ya doing?\nRORY: Good, how about you?\nJESS: Good. You hungry?\nRORY: Starved.\nJESS: I know a place.\n[They walk off together.]\nCUT TO NEW YORK STREET\n[Jess and Rory are walking down the street]\nRORY: I feel very urban today.\nJESS: Oh yeah, the plaid just screams urban.\nRORY: I think I look like a native.\nJESS: How well do you know Manhattan?\nRORY: I've been here a few times. We saw The Bangles here.\nJESS: When was that, twenty years ago?\nRORY: It was a reunion and they were great.\nJESS: Yeah, they're okay.\nRORY: And a couple years ago Mom drove us in to shop, and she couldn't find a good parking place and all of the parking lots were a total rip-off, so she kept making U-turns and cutting off taxis and we were being screamed at in so many different languages that we just turned around and drove home and bought a Hummel at the curio store in Stars Hollow.\nJESS: How very adventurous.\nRORY: I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple.\nJESS: You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.\nRORY: So I don't have the lingo down yet, but at least I have the attitude.\nJESS: You do, huh?\nRORY: Oh yeah. When I was getting a locker for my backpack at the bus stop, there was this guy and he was just standing there staring at me and instead of ignoring him I just fixed him with a really withering stare.\nJESS: That I've got to see.\nRORY: No.\nJESS: Oh, come on, let me see your withering stare.\nRORY: It's dangerous. I could hurt you.\nJESS: I've been hurt before.\nRORY: No.\nJESS: I'm disappointed. So your arm's okay?\nRORY: Yeah, it looks worse than it is.\nJESS: [Looks at Rory's cast.] I like this Emily chick. Friend of yours?\nRORY: She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.\nJESS: So here's our lunch place.\nRORY: A hot dog stand?\nJESS: Hey, I eat here everyday. It's nothing fancy, but -\nRORY: No, I love it. It's perfect.\nJESS: Good. [to hot dog vendor] One with everything on it.\nRORY: Make that two, please.\nJESS: So, uh. . .how's -\nRORY: Luke?\nJESS: Yeah.\nRORY: Okay. He went fishing.\nJESS: Fishing?\nRORY: Yeah. He didn't catch anything though.\nJESS: Probably used the wrong bait.\nRORY: Yeah, that's a common fishing blunder.\nJESS: So he's good?\nRORY: Yeah, he's good. I can tell him hello for you if you want.\nJESS: Whatever.\nRORY: [to hot dog vendor] Thank you. [takes a bite] Oh, my God, this is really good!\nJESS: I'm glad you like it. So how much time you got?\nRORY: I got a bit.\nJESS: There's a record store you should check out. It's run by this insane freak who's like a walking encyclopedia for every punk and garage-band record ever made. Catalog numbers. . .it's crazy. The place is right out of High Fidelity.\nRORY: Let's go.\nJESS: Okay.\nRORY: Where you going?\nJESS: Subway.\nRORY: I thought we were gonna walk.\nJESS: It's fifteen blocks. Come on, I think you'll like it.\nRORY: Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?\nJESS: You are so an out-of-towner.\nCUT TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n[Lorelai walks into the auditorium, then follows a sign to the graduate check-in room.]\nLORELAI: Excuse me, hi, I'm one of the graduates.\nMAN: Wow, you're hours early.\nLORELAI: Yeah, well, I just wanted to beat traffic and have time to get ready and relax, and also, I've heard the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains in them.\nMAN: This is true. Take your pick.\nLORELAI: Thank you. This is so exciting. Isn't this exciting?\nMAN: This is my eighth year of doing this.\nLORELAI: So, not so exciting for you, got it.\n[As Lorelai looks through a rack of gowns, Emily walks by the open door. Lorelai catches a glimpse of her]\nLORELAI: Huh.\n[Lorelai thinks for a moment, then goes into the auditorium to see if it was really Emily]\nEMILY: [to cameraman] You're being so cryptic. Do you need a power source or not?\nRAUL: Look, my batteries are all fully charged. It just depends on how fast they deplete.\nEMILY: So, we need one just in case?\nLORELAI: Mom.\nEMILY: Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony. What are you doing here?\nLORELAI: Um, I'm just getting. . .I'm sorry, what are you doing here? How do you even know about this?\nEMILY: I shouldn't know about this? A mother can't know about this?\nLORELAI: No, I just mean -\nEMILY: You're graduating.\nLORELAI: I know.\nEMILY: So, we're here to see you graduate. This is Raul.\nLORELAI: Hey. So, you and Raul are just here to see me graduate?\nEMILY: Don't be silly. Your father will be joining me later.\nLORELAI: My father?\nEMILY: Yes, remember him? Tall, bow tie.\nLORELAI: I remember Dad, Mom. I just. . .ah, Rory told you.\nEMILY: Yes. That's okay, isn't it? It's a little late if it's not.\nLORELAI: Oh, no, it's perfectly fine that you're here, absolutely. I'm just surprised. [to Raul] Who are you?\nRAUL: I'm Raul.\nEMILY: I just told you that.\nLORELAI: Yes, well, did Rory invite Raul, too?\nEMILY: Raul is my cameraman.\nLORELAI: Cameraman?\nEMILY: He's going to be filming the ceremony for us. He's very talented. He screened an independent film of his as an audition, \"Welcome to Scab Land.\"\nIt was disgusting, but beautifully photographed.\nRAUL: It was supposed to be disgusting.\nLORELAI: I'm sure it was. Mom, all this stuff. . .\nMAN: Excuse me, all of this equipment, it can't be here.\nEMILY: Well, obviously we're not going to leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over. We're not cretins.\nLORELAI: She's handling it. Right, Mom? You're handling it.\nRAUL: Okay, this lighting sucks!\nEMILY: Can we do something about the lighting?\nMAN: I don't think so, ma'am. I don't know.\nEMILY: [to Raul] It's a community college, we'll just have to cope. Think documentary.\nLORELAI: Mom, please. People will be showing up here soon. You can't --\nEMILY: Lorelai, I am perfectly capable of handling this. No one will be inconvenienced.\nLORELAI: Okay, I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all this because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee and maybe hammer a nail into my head.\nEMILY: You're not needed here, Lorelai. Go get your coffee, relax. You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?\nLORELAI: Maybe an Irish coffee.\nCUT TO NEW YORK RECORD STORE\n[Rory and Jess are looking through the records]\nJESS: I haven't even heard of half these bands.\nRORY: I love that about this place. God, Lane would wanna live here.\nJESS: Who's Slim?\nRORY: I don't know.\nOWNER: Grunge band out of Kentucky. Two albums, plus a double-A side single, disbanded in '94.\nJESS: Thanks.\nRORY: [looks through the records] Oh my God!\nJESS: What?\nRORY: Look! [shows him a record]\nJESS: Go-go's. You must have that one.\nRORY: No, for my mom. This was her favorite group when she was my age, and it's signed by Belinda. This would be the perfect graduation present. I've been looking for something all week long, and I couldn't find anything and now I have Belinda.\nJESS: Graduation?\nRORY: Oh, from college, from business classes.\nJESS: I'm surprised she has time for anything except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.\nRORY: Well, it's not a lot of time, but . . .\nJESS: Uh-huh. Go on, get it. She'll like it.\nRORY: Thank you so much for bringing me here. This was fate.\nJESS: Yes, it was.\nRORY: And in return, I just might show you my withering stare.\nJESS: I'm a lucky man.\nCUT TO BUS STATION\n[Rory and Jess are walking toward her bus]\nRORY: I think this one's mine.\nJESS: Yup, the sign says Boonesville.\nTOURIST: Excuse me, I'm so sorry to bother you. Which way is 44th?\nRORY: Oh, um, that way.\nTOURIST: Great, thanks.\nRORY: I got asked directions.\nJESS: I saw.\nRORY: He took me for a native. That's so cool.\nJESS: That's very impressive. 44th's the other way.\nRORY: Oh no.\nJESS: Sorry.\nRORY: Oh, man, I should go find him.\nJESS: He'll figure it out when he sees all the numbers getting smaller instead of bigger.\nRORY: He still thought I was a native. That's cool.\nJESS: I'm your witness.\nRORY: Well, I should go.\nJESS: Okay.\nRORY: I gotta go to my mom's graduation.\nJESS: And give her Belinda.\nRORY: And give her Belinda.\nJESS: Go on. I'll check on the guy, I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44.\n[Rory boards the bus and looks at Jess through the window.]\nJESS: Why did you come here?\n[Rory opens the window.]\nRORY: What?\nJESS: I said, why did you come here?\nRORY: Well -\nJESS: I mean, you ditched school and everything. That's so not you. Why'd you do it?\nRORY: Because you didn't say goodbye.\nJESS: Oh. Bye, Rory.\nRORY: Bye, Jess.\nCUT TO GRADUATE CHECK-IN ROOM\n[Lorelai is fixing her makeup near the chalkboard. She sneezes and stirs up a cloud of chalk dust.]\nLORELAI: Great, I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.\nLIZA: You thought ahead. Smart.\nLORELAI: Oh, the mirror? Yeah, I never leave home without all the essentials: mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy. I'm done. Do you want to use it?\nLIZA: Thanks. Oh, don't I look charming?\nLORELAI: Oh, you look great.\nLIZA: I've looked better. I had to run here straight from work -- Kinko's.\nZACH: Hey, Liza, that gets me thinking maybe you and I oughta do a little reproducing after the ceremony.\nLIZA: Clever.\nZACH: Don't be a snot.\nLIZA: Shut up! [to Lorelai] That's my boyfriend, Zach.\nLORELAI: Oh, sure.\nLIZA: Of course, we're breaking up 'cause we're transferring to different schools. He's going to Florida State, I'm going to UMass. . .although I'm kinda going to miss this place.\nZACH: I'm not. This place stunk. It's Bush League.\nLORELAI: Why'd you go here?\nZACH: My parents, wise investors that they are, couldn't afford anything else.\nLIZA: Yeah, I guess that two-point-zilch grade point average didn't reason into things.\nZACH: Shut up.\nLIZA: Between the lines.\nZACH: Go die.\nLORELAI: Are you sure you two don't wanna give it another go, 'cause you're darling together.\nLIZA: Thanks for the mirror.\nLORELAI: My pleasure.\nLIZA: Hey, a bunch of us are going to Shakey's afterwards for a pizza. You wanna come?\nLORELAI: Aw, I'm going out with my daughter after, but it sounds like fun.\nZACH: Okay, you guys are not going to believe this. There's some blue-blooded rich woman out there setting up professional film equipment like she's sh**ting a movie or something.\nLORELAI: You're kidding.\nLIZA: Whose mother is it?\nZACH: I don't know. Little Precious must be around here somewhere though.\nLIZA: I hate people with money.\nZACH: So do I, with every fiber of my being.\nLORELAI: Me too. Money people, ugh.\nCUT TO BUS\n[Rory's bus is still at the station. She walks up to the bus driver.]\nRORY: Excuse me?\nDRIVER: Yes?\nRORY: Are we leaving soon?\nDRIVER: I have no idea.\nRORY: Well, should you have an idea?\nDRIVER: There was an accident, closed the interstate. All outbound buses were told to stand down.\nRORY: Oh. And you don't know when we're going to be allowed to stand up again?\nDRIVER: Soon, I hope. I hate missing dinner.\nRORY: Yeah. . .me, too.\nCUT TO GRADUATE CHECK-IN ROOM\n[Sookie and Jackson walk over to Lorelai]\nSOOKIE: There's our little graduate. Oh, my God, look at that gown. You look just like the Statue of Liberty.\nLORELAI: Ah, all big and stony?\nSOOKIE: No, you look amazing.\nLORELAI: Hmm. You look very G.Q.\nJACKSON: Oh, thanks to my best new friend Ermenegildo Zegna.\nSOOKIE: Don't you love how he can pronounce it and all?\nLORELAI: Very Cosmopolitan.\nSOOKIE: He got it for the rehearsal dinner. It's his first real suit.\nJACKSON: And not my last. I look hot!\nLORELAI: Mmm.\nSOOKIE: So, you know that Emily's out there, right?\nLORELAI: Oh, shh!\nSOOKIE: Why shh?\nLORELAI: It's a long story. Just do me a favor?\nSOOKIE: Sure.\nLORELAI: Keep an eye on my parents, make sure they don't disrupt anything, my mother doesn't behead anyone, my father doesn't snore too loudly when he falls asleep.\nSOOKIE: They're not gonna do anything like that.\nLORELAI: I'm sorry, have you not met them?\nSOOKIE: Why would they come and do that?\nLORELAI: They're here because Rory invited them.\nSOOKIE: No.\nLORELAI: Yes! They can't say no to that little face. It's like hitting a puppy with a rolled-up newspaper.\nZACH: Hey, you guys are not gonna believe this.\nLIZA: You're Mr. Announcement Guy today.\nZACH: What, are you going to pipe in every time I talk?\nLIZA: Can it!\nZACH: Stuff it!\nLORELAI: They're in love.\nSOOKIE: Clearly.\nZACH: So, Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too.\nLORELAI: [quietly] Oh, no.\nZACH: It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.\nSOOKIE: [quietly] That's Emily, right?\nLORELAI: Shh!\nLIZA: Rich people feel so entitled.\nLORELAI: Yeah, damn them!\nZACH: I swear, I saw her wipe her face with a hundred dollar bill.\nLORELAI: We should line them up against a wall, you know what I'm saying?\nWOMAN: Is Lorelai Gilmore here?\nLORELAI: Yes.\nWOMAN: Oh, good. Have a look at these, will you? [shows her a box of corsages]\nLORELAI: Wow!\nSOOKIE: Pretty.\nWOMAN: Look them over and take your pick.\nLORELAI: What for?\nWOMAN: To wear.\nLORELAI: Are they for sale?\nWOMAN: No, they're paid for. These are from your mother, Emily Gilmore.\nLIZA: Wow, ritzy.\nLORELAI: I really don't want to wear a corsage.\nWOMAN: They're all paid for.\nLORELAI: Really, it's too much.\nWOMAN: Your mother wants you to pick one.\nLORELAI: Really, it's okay.\nWOMAN: She'll just come back here herself.\nLORELAI: This one, thanks.\nWOMAN: Good choice. The cameraman said that would look best on film.\nZACH: So you're the rich girl.\nLORELAI: Maybe. I'm not rich but . . .my parents have money, but I'm totally self-sufficient. I take nothing from them, except this corsage. . .and my daughter's tuition. So, you gonna stone me?\nZACH: I should have guessed. Look at her friends, they're wearing suits that drip money.\nJACKSON: Hey pal, this was thirty percent off!\nLIZA: So, that's why you didn't want to get pizza, 'cause it's below you?\nLORELAI: Oh, no, no, no, Liza, pizza is not below me. Believe me, I love pizza. I eat tons of pizza. It's one of my four major food groups: candy, popcorn, and pizza see? It's two of my food groups, that's how much I love pizza.\nLIZA: I want to believe you.\nZACH: Enjoy your champagne and caviar at The Ritz, Your Highness.\nLORELAI: I am not rich! Ugh! [Pager beeps] My pager.\nJACKSON: Maybe the suit was a little much.\nSOOKIE: You're a fox, now don't start.\nLORELAI: [reads pager] Oh, no.\nSOOKIE: What?\nLORELAI: Rory's running late.\nSOOKIE: Late from what?\nLORELAI: It doesn't say. It says she's definitely going to be here but if she's not here by seven, she'll sneak in the back. That's weird.\nSOOKIE: She'll be here, don't worry.\nLORELAI: I hope so.\nSOOKIE: How 'bout we sit in back, keep an eye out for her, and we'll save her a seat?\nLORELAI: That'd be great. Oh, can you hang onto all my stuff for me? I don't want to leave it in here.\nSOOKIE: Will do.\nLORELAI: Thank you. Bye.\nZACH: Oh, you don't trust your valuables around us poor kids, huh?\nLORELAI: Knock it off, Zach!\nCUT TO BUS\n[Rory's bus makes a stop and some people get off]\nSEATMATE: You don't look happy.\nRORY: I'm late.\nSEATMATE: Buses are the worst.\nRORY: Why are we making so many stops? The bus didn't make stops on the way into the city.\nSEATMATE: Oh, that was probably an express. This is a local makes a lot of stops.\nRORY: I should have checked the schedule. I should have checked traffic. Note to self: impulsive definitely does not work for me. [notices seatmate holding a soda can to his lips] What are you doing?\nSEATMATE: Hmm? Oh, uh, it's for my spit.\nRORY: Your what?\nSEATMATE: From my smokeless.\nCUT TO GRADUATION CEREMONY\n[A speaker on stage is calling the graduates up]\nSPEAKER: Victor David Fuller. . .

I don't want the whole damn ceremony and none of her.\nRICHARD: Oh, no, I disagree. I hope he gets every inspired word articulated by the East Coast Marketing Director of Pup n' Taco.\nEMILY: Raul!\n[As Emily points to the stage, Raul and the sound guy rush down the aisle.]\nSPEAKER: Joanne Garver...\n[Raul shoves the camera in Lorelai's face.]\nLORELAI: Oh, geez. Oh, we're, oh, we're going. . .\nSPEAKER: John Lawrence Gilfer. . . Lorelai Victoria Gilmore. . . Gretchen Greeman. . .\n[Emily and Richard look on proudly as Lorelai accepts her diploma and moves her tassel to the other side of her cap.]\nCUT TO AUDITORIUM\n[After the ceremony, Lorelai walks up to Emily and Richard]\nLORELAI: Hey, Mom, Dad.\nEMILY: Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Well, I did it.\nRICHARD: Yes.\nEMILY: Raul thinks he got some good footage.\nRICHARD: I should hope so. He certainly cost enough.\nLORELAI: I'm sure it'll be great.\nEMILY: Congratulations, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Thank you. I'm glad you guys came.\nEMILY: Yes, well, we should get going. I guess we'll see you tomorrow for dinner. [they start to leave]\nLORELAI: Hey, wait. Aren't we going to take a picture?\nEMILY: Excuse me?\nLORELAI: The three of us, me in the middle with the gown, you know the traditional pose.\nRICHARD: Well, uh, we don't have a camera with us.\nLORELAI: Hold on. [pulls the disposable camera out of her pocket]\nEMILY: That's a camera?\nLORELAI: That's a camera.\nRICHARD: That looks like a toy.\nLORELAI: Um, Raul, would you mind? [they pose together] So. . .\nRAUL: Okay, on the count of one, two, three, cheese! [takes picture]\nLORELAI: Thank you.\nEMILY: Yes, well, tomorrow then.\nLORELAI: Absolutely.\nEMILY: Let's go, Richard.\nRICHARD: I'll be right there, Emily. [hands Lorelai an envelope] Congratulations.\nLORELAI: Oh, you don't have to do this.\nRICHARD: Put it towards something fun.\nLORELAI: Thank you, Daddy.\n[Emily and Richard leave as Sookie and Jackson walk over]\nSOOKIE: Hey, we're so proud of you!\nJACKSON: Yeah, you were great up there.\nLORELAI: Thanks, you guys. Where's Rory? No Rory?\nSOOKIE: She called your cell and I answered and she said she got hung up on something or other and she'll see you at home.\nLORELAI: Hung up? Hung up where? Is she okay?\nSOOKIE: She said she's fine. She's sorry, but fine.\nLORELAI: Oh. Well, as long as she's okay, I guess. Um, well, I should probably get the gown back. Thanks for coming, Sook, Marcus Schenkenberg.\nSOOKIE: You wanna go out to eat? Celebrate a little?\nLORELAI: No, I think I'll just go home to Rory.\nSOOKIE: I thought so. See you tomorrow.\nLORELAI: Thanks.\nJACKSON: Wait a minute. . .aspirins instead of Jordan Almonds? But we already bought the almonds.\nSOOKIE: Wow. Now that's the longest anything's ever taken.\nJACKSON: My family's not gonna get the joke. Can't we just use the almonds?\nSOOKIE: Okay, sweetie, calm down.\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Rory is waiting out front as Lorelai pulls into the driveway.]\nRORY: I'm so, so sorry.\nLORELAI: You're okay, right?\nRORY: Yes.\nLORELAI: Everything's working? Your wrist is okay, nothing new is broken?\nRORY: I'm fine.\nLORELAI: Anyone you know, like Lane or someone, suddenly get sick today or break an arm themselves or get in a car wreck?\nRORY: No.\nLORELAI: Okay, good. Then I can get past worry and move onto other things.\nRORY: I know you're hurt.\nLORELAI: Yeah, you bet I'm hurt. Rory, I really wanted you there today, more than anything. You're why I did this stupid thing in the first place.\nRORY: I know.\nLORELAI: It was a once in a lifetime thing. You should've been there. My best friend should've been there. Whatever it was that kept you, you should've gotten out of it, at least this once. Was it school?\nRORY: It wasn't school.\nLORELAI: Was it Paris?\nRORY: It wasn't Paris.\nLORELAI: Well, what was it?\nRORY: It was so stupid.\nLORELAI: Well, Rory, where were you? What happened?\nRORY: I cut school!\nLORELAI: You what?\nRORY: I cut school and I got on a bus and I don't even know why I did it. I. . .I have no excuse. I was just standing outside of Chilton, and I don't know, I must have had a stroke or something. What does a stroke feel like?\nLORELAI: I don't know. Not good, probably.\nRORY: And I left school and I got on a bus and I went to New York. And that's it! I'm grounded for six months, or seven, and no TV, no stereo, no reading. In fact, take all of my books away from me and lock them up.\nLORELAI: Hold on here. You went to New York?\nRORY: And no magazines, either. And I'm going to do all of the housework. Laundry, dishes. . . in fact, we're going to start eating at home so that we have dishes.\nLORELAI: Rory.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: Stop. Why did you go to New York?\nRORY: To see Jess.\nLORELAI: Boy, do you know how to bury the lead.\nRORY: I don't know what happened.\nLORELAI: You went to New York to see Jess.\nRORY: It was the stroke! It made me someone else, and after his phone call last night -\nLORELAI: That was him?\nRORY: It did something to me, I don't know what. In fact, you should take the phone away from me, too. That's right, add it to the list. No books, no music, no phone.\nLORELAI: Okay, Rory. . .\nRORY: I'm a horrible person.\nLORELAI: You're not a horrible person.\nRORY: I am sick, I'm ill, I'm cracked. This is not who I am. If I were to write this down in my diary and I would read it, I would be like, Who is this freak? This isn't me. This isn't my diary. I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't skip school when I have finals coming up to go see a guy that isn't even my guy and end up missing my mother's graduation, which I wanted to be at so badly. That's someone else. That's someone flighty and stupid and dumb and girly. And, I mean, I missed your graduation, which is the worst thing I could have possibly done. I mean, I hurt you and I had to spend hours on a stinky bus next to a guy that was spitting into a can, just thinking about all of the minutes that were going by that I wasn't at your graduation and they were hurting you, and they should have been hurting you because it was so selfish of this person who wasn't me to do what she did.\nLORELAI: Okay, my God, take a breath.\nRORY: I don't deserve a breath. No breaths. You should add that to the list. You should beat me, ground me, take the phone away and deprive me of air.\nLORELAI: Okay, look, nobody wants to say this any less than me, but I - maybe you don't have a medical condition or a mental problem. Maybe, honey, you are falling for Jess.\nRORY: No.\nLORELAI: Well -\nRORY: No, I love Dean. Dean is my boyfriend. He will always be my boyfriend. That's it. Forever.\nLORELAI: Well, maybe not forever.\nRORY: Yes, forever. I love Dean and Jess is gone now and everything's going to be good again. Everything's going to be all right.\nLORELAI: Rory, you cut school.\nRORY: Yeah, I know.\nLORELAI: You got on a bus and went to a strange city in your uniform to see Jess.\nRORY: I know.\nLORELAI: Well, that doesn't mean nothing. That means something. I mean--\nRORY: No! I don't want to talk about this anymore. The only thing I want to talk about is the list I made on the bus of all the ways I'm gonna make this up to you. You get total control over the remote and the stereo for as long as you want. Total control over takeout food choices and a special surprise present every day for a month and -- oh my God! I left your present on the bus.\nLORELAI: What present?\nRORY: It was a vinyl copy of The Go-Gos original album and it was signed by Belinda, but it's not the only copy and I'm gonna find another copy. That's going on the list, too.\nLORELAI: Okay, honey, please. Forget about the list until tomorrow.\nRORY: Okay, I'll just go to bed then and...I'll go to my room.\nLORELAI: Hold on one second. Does this mean I have to eat alone?\nRORY: Well, it's up to you. Sending me to bed without supper, you can't lose with that punishment. It's a classic.\nLORELAI: I'd rather go out with my daughter tonight.\nRORY: I don't deserve it.\nLORELAI: No, but I do.\nRORY: Okay, just let me take a shower and get the horrible smell of this horrible day off of me, and then we'll go anywhere you want, my treat, and I won't enjoy it. And then we'll come home and I'll go straight to bed and I'll have a terrible night's sleep, okay?\nLORELAI: Sounds great.\nRORY: I'm so, so sorry, Mom.\nLORELAI: Oh, really? 'Cause you didn't make that clear.\nRORY: I won't be long.\nTHE END\nF.D. » Transcripts » G » Gilmore Girls","categories":[{"score":0.773,"name":"Fine Art","id":"iabv2-201"}]}]}
