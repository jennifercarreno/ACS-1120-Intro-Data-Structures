OPEN AT LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table. Lorelai's eating breakfast while Rory watches her.]
RORY: How are the eggs?
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: I'm glad.
LORELAI: They're still good.
RORY: I'm still glad.
LORELAI: Look freak, we will not be late.
RORY: It's the first day of school. I wanna get there early.
LORELAI: We will be there early, I promise.
RORY: I have different classes this year, my routes aren't the same. I haven't found the quickest path around. And my locker, they moved it, so I don't even know if it'll work properly and then I'll have to get a new one and God knows how long that'll take or where it'll be and that could send the whole day into chaos. I'm just excited.
[Lane walks into the diner]
LANE: Oh, thank God, you haven't left yet.
RORY: Nope, what's up?
LANE: Well, I found the greatest record store in the world. It's ten minutes from your school and I'm wondering how much you love me.
RORY: Address.
LANE: Record Breaker Incorporated, 2453 Berlin Turnpike.
RORY: Got it. Place your order now.
LANE: Okay, Charles Mingus, "The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady."
LORELAI: Mm.
RORY: Right.
LANE: The Sonics, Here are the Sonics.
RORY: Burn me a copy. Next.
LANE: MC5, Kick Out the Jams. Fairport Convention, Leige and Lief. BeeGees, Odessa.
RORY: BeeGees, really?
LANE: Well, Mojo says.
RORY: So it must be true.
LANE: Okay, that's it. Now if I could just find a copy of Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill, I will finally be done with the sixties.
RORY: I can get there today, tomorrow at the latest.
LANE: I love it when you go back to school.
RORY: Me too. Hey!
LORELAI: I am getting donuts for later. As soon as I do, I will take you to school and the nice men in the white coats will pick you up.
[Lorelai walks up to the counter. Taylor is standing there with a group of Boy Scouts.]
TAYLOR: Everybody, listen up. Decide what you want, place your order, and then proceed to the end of the line.
BOY 1: I want a burger.
BOY 2: I want grilled cheese.
BOY 3: Me too.
BOY 2: And I want fries, and make them really really cripsy.
BOY 1: I want mine crispy too.
BOY 2: You didn't order fries.
BOY 1: So?
LUKE: So you can't order crispy fries without first ordering fries.
BOY 1: Why not?
LUKE: Because you can't make something crispy that doesn't exist.
BOY 1: Why not?
LUKE: Get him away from me Taylor.
TAYLOR: Have some respect. These boys have just completed the first leg of their outdoor survival training.
LUKE: Meaning you had them sit under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours.
TAYLOR: You're a very jaded man Luke. What happened to you as a child?
LUKE: Some creepy guy in shorts and knee socks tried to sit me under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours. Put that down!
BOY 4: Why?
LUKE: Because otherwise you're going under it.
BOY 4: I won't fit.
LUKE: Oh yes you will.
LORELAI: Hey, donuts please.
BOY 1: We were here first!
LORELAI: On the planet?
BOY 1: Huh?
LORELAI: You lose. Chocolate, cinnamon and sprinkles.
[phone rings; Lorelai and the kids moan as Luke goes to answer it.]
LUKE: All of you pipe down.
LORELAI: Grups, huh?
LUKE: [on phone] Yeah, I'm working. What do you think I'm doing? Uh huh. Uh huh. Oh man, what did you do? Excuse me, are you serious? Just like that, huh?
[Lorelai goes behind the counter and gets her own donuts]
BOY 2: Hey Mr. Doose. She's not supposed to do that.
TAYLOR: That's right. She's breaking the rules, and people who break the rules end up very lonely with no friends because they have become society's outcasts.
LORELAI: Planning on burning a little Huck Finn after lunch, Taylor?
TAYLOR: Excuse me?
LUKE: [on phone] This is unbelievable! You won't ever change, will you? . . . Okay, fine. Do what you want, make the arrangements. Now I'm working, we'll finish this later. [hangs up]
LORELAI: Is everything okay?
LUKE: Do you have a sister?
LORELAI: Um, no.
BOY 1: I do.
LUKE: You have my sympathies.
BOY 1: Thanks. I appreciate that.
[opening credits]
CUT TO FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER
[Luke walks towards the diner carrying several shopping bags. He drops a bag on the sidewalk. Lorelai is walking by and stops to help.]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hello.
LORELAI: What are you doing?
LUKE: Ah, just redecorating the sidewalk.
LORELAI: Oh, it looks nice.
LUKE: Yeah yeah yeah, you don't think too much blue?
LORELAI: No, just enough.
LUKE: Yeah, well, thanks for the input. You can go now.
LORELAI: Need some help?
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: Need some help?
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: Need some help?
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: So do you need some help?
[Luke sighs.]
CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke and Lorelai walk down the hallway to Luke's apartment. Luke is carrying the shopping bags, Lorelai is carrying a box of cereal. Luke unlocks the door.]
LORELAI: Frosted Flakes? Since when do you buy Frosted Flakes? [Luke drops some bags, food spills all over.] Okay, now what is going on?
LUKE: Nothing.
LORELAI: Nothing? You just all of sudden woke up this morning and decided you were gonna buy every food item in the world that you don't actually eat?
LUKE: It's not for me.
LORELAI: Well who's it for?
LUKE: Someone who's not me.
LORELAI: Like who?
[cut to inside apartment]
LUKE: Like my nephew.
LORELAI: Oh, your nephew's coming to visit.
LUKE: No, he's coming to stay.
LORELAI: You're sister's moving here?
[they start picking up the spilled food in the hallway and bringing it inside]
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry, I don't get it.
LUKE: There's nothing to get. It's just Liz. She's too busy, she can't handle him, she's sending him here.
LORELAI: Where's his dad?
LUKE: Oh well, the great prize that my sister picked up at a Der Wienerschnitzel left her about two years ago, whereabouts unknown.
LORELAI: Aww, geez.
LUKE: Yup.
LORELAI: So she's just sending him here, just like that?
LUKE: Oh no, I'm sure she put at least five or six minutes of thought into it.
LORELAI: But why?
LUKE: Well, 'cause apparently he's been getting into some trouble and Liz is afraid he's heading for something bad, and rather than handle it herself, she's just giving up. She's sending him here so I can straighten him out.
LORELAI: You?
LUKE: Yes.
LORELAI: You can straighten him out?
LUKE: Yes.
LORELAI: You, Luke Danes, the great communicator, you're going to straighten the kid out?
LUKE: All he needs is a change of pace, a new crowd, and to get away from the nutjob that, unfortunately, is my sister.
LORELAI: Well, how long is he staying?
LUKE: I don't know. Indefinitely.
LORELAI: And how old is he?
LUKE: Seventeen.
LORELAI: Oh, wow. That is very generous of you.
LUKE: Well, it's family, what else can you do?
LORELAI: Right. So what kind of trouble has he gotten into?
LUKE: Ah, just kid stuff, you know, staying out late, getting rowdy. I don't know exactly.
LORELAI: Well, you might want to find out. Ask a couple of subtle questions, you know, has he seen The Shawshank Redemption, did the setting seem homey to him? Stuff like that.
LUKE: Look, his problem is obvious, it's his mother. You never could count on Liz for anything. Our mom died when we were kids, right? It was just my dad, me and Liz. And my dad worked all the time and I worked in the store with my dad, and Liz was off doing God knows what.
LORELAI: Well, I bet losing her mom so early was kind of hard on her.
LUKE: It was hard on all of us, but we did our part. And then the minute she graduates high school, she is outta here. Didn't matter that my dad was sick, didn't matter that the store was failing, she just took off. Married the hot dog king, had a kid, he left, now here we are. [Luke starts pumping up an air mattress]
LORELAI: Yeah, wow, that'sI'm sorry, what are you doing?
LUKE: I'm blowing this up.
LORELAI: What is it?
LUKE: It's a bed.
LORELAI: A bed?
LUKE: For Jess.
LORELAI: Jess?
LUKE: Jess, my nephew.
LORELAI: Luke, um, that's not a bed, that's a raft, which is fine if you're gonna build a moat around the diner but
LUKE: It's fine.
LORELAI: Luke, the kid needs a bed. If you want to get him something inflatable, make it a blonde.
LUKE: I'm getting him a bed, this is just temporary.
LORELAI: Hey, how does Jess feel about this?
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: You haven't talked to him about it?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Don't you think you should?
LUKE: Why? He doesn't have a choice. His mom's a flake, he's coming here, end of story.
LORELAI: Are you sure you're ready for this?
LUKE: Of course I'm sure.
LORELAI: I mean, taking on a full time kid, that's a lot of work.
LUKE: I know.
LORELAI: And a seventeen-year-old that's been getting into trouble and now is being shipped off without his consent, that could be even harder.
LUKE: Look, all he needs is to be around someone who's not a selfish basketcase, who will give him a little space, who will treat him like a man.
LORELAI: Maybe you should think about this.
LUKE: There's nothing to think about. He's family. You take care of family, period.
LORELAI: Yes, I respect that, but what if he turns out to be Fredo?
LUKE: Are you seriously telling me not to do this?
LORELAI: No, I'm not telling you not to do this.
LUKE: Then what are you saying?
LORELAI: I'm just saying that if you need any help, I'm here.
LUKE: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
LUKE: Look, I got a lot of things to do before he gets here so
LORELAI: Okay, I'm leaving. Oh, you do have an extra set of sheets, right?
LUKE: Yes, I do.
LORELAI: Sorry, just checking. Bye. [leaves]
LUKE: [grabs keys] Sheets, sheets.
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory is walking down the hallway towards a classroom. Paris, Madeline and Louise are walking towards the same room from the other direction. They stop in front of the doorway and look at each other before going inside.]
RORY: Okay, round two.
CUT TO INSIDE CLASSROOM
[Rory walks over to Paris.]
RORY: Five seconds?
PARIS: Four.
RORY: Fine.
PARIS: Now it's three.
RORY: Paris, it does not have to be like this.
PARIS: No?
RORY: You and I are going to have to spend a lot of time in class together on The Franklin.
PARIS: I know.
RORY: We're gonna have to sit in the same classroom, share the same oxygen, occasionally make eye contact.
PARIS: I can avoid that.
RORY: Look, I'm not saying that we should be friends. I don't want to be friends. I'm just saying that maybe we should look at this like life.
PARIS: Life?
RORY: Yes, in life there will be people that you don't like, but that you have to coexist with.
PARIS: I am well aware of that.
RORY: So I'm just suggesting that we coexist.
PARIS: You're just scared that I'm gonna make your life on The Franklin a living hell. Especially since I'm the editor and you'reoh, what's the wordnot.
RORY: If you want to spend the precious energy that you'd normally spend on the paper obsessing on ways to make me miserable, then that's your choice. I'm just suggesting an alternate plan. The paper could be really great this year.
PARIS: I know.
RORY: So, can't we just agree on that and make all the rest of it go away?
[Louise and Madeline walk over]
LOUISE: Everything okay?
RORY: Yeah, Riff, everything's fine.
PARIS: We were just talking.
MADELINE: Talking? You two?
PARIS: About The Franklin.
MADELINE: Oh. Nope, still seems weird.
PARIS: Hey, look, we're all on the paper together. There's gonna be a lot of long afternoons and weekends.
LOUISE: Weekends?
PARIS: We need to coexist, right?
RORY: Right.
LOUISE: I'm sorry. Back up to the weekends.
PARIS: So that's what we'll do. Now the first meeting of The Franklin is today.
RORY: Yes it is.
PARIS: Four o'clock.
RORY: Sounds good.
LOUISE: Weekends were never mentioned. I need my weekends. All of this gets done on weekends.
CUT TO BUSSTOP
[Luke is waiting on the bench. The bus pulls up and Jess steps off.]
LUKE: Jess.
JESS: Luke.
LUKE: Okay, so uh [Luke walks towards the diner, Jess follows]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Luke and Jess walk through the door.]
LUKE: Well, this is my diner.
JESS: Huh.
LUKE: Belonged to your Grandpa.
JESS: Huh.
LUKE: Yup.
CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke and Jess walk through the door.]
LUKE: Well, here we are. It's pretty simple. You know, this is the room. That's my bed, that's your, uh, bed for now, but the sheets are new. There's the bathroom, there's the closet, there's the dresser, the phone, and over there is the kitchen. I've got Frosted Flakes.
JESS: Wow, that's grrrrreat.
LUKE: So, is that all your stuff?
JESS: Yup.
LUKE: Not much there.
JESS: Well, Lizzie's sending the rest later.
LUKE: So, you need some help?
JESS: Nope.
LUKE: Okay, uh, I have to get back to the diner. I'm gonna close up at ten tonight, so I thought
JESS: See you at ten.
LUKE: But wait, you need keys.
JESS: No I don't. [leaves]
LUKE: I so don't wanna know why.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Jess walks out of the diner, looks around the town, and walks down the street.]
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory sits down on a bench to read before the newspaper meeting starts. She hears voices from inside the room and goes inside. Several students and a teacher are sitting at a table.]
PARIS: Pick a side people. Oh, Rory.
RORY: Hey.
TEACHER: Nice of you to join us, Miss Gilmore.
RORY: I thought we were starting at four.
TEACHER: No, we start at 3:15 sharp.
PARIS: Look, we're wasting time here.
TEACHER: Take a seat Miss Gilmore.
RORY: Sorry.
PARIS: Okay, so we were just finishing up handing out the first assignments. Now, Rory, unfortunately, since you got here so late, most everything of interest has been given out.
RORY: Why, I'm shocked.
PARIS: Wait, wait, just let me check my list here. There might be something left for you. Okay, well, here, they're paving the new parking lot tomorrow.
RORY: And?
PARIS: And you can cover it.
RORY: Cover what?
PARIS: The paving process.
RORY: You're serious?
PARIS: Absolutely. I'm sure there's an angle there somewhere. Is it environmentally safe? What are the financial ramifications? Should brick have been considered especially taking into account the architecture of the building?
RORY: Yeah yeah, I get the idea.
PARIS: But hey, if you think this is below you, you can always wait until the next issue. You can just use this time to get a nice manicure.
RORY: That's okay.
PARIS: Maybe get a massage.
RORY: I'll do it.
PARIS: Aromatherapy. Smell like a peach for a few days.
RORY: I said I'll do it, okay? I'll cover the paving.
PARIS: Okay, good. Well then, I guess that's it.
[Everyone gets up from the table. Paris walks to a computer and starts typing. Rory walks over to her.]
PARIS: Problem, Miss Gilmore?
RORY: Nope, no problem at all. I love this assignment.
PARIS: I'm glad.
RORY: I'm gonna write the greatest piece on pavement you've ever read.
PARIS: I hope so.
RORY: And next week, when you give me the scoop on the new copper plumbing installation, I'm gonna be just as thrilled.
PARIS: I like a team player.
RORY: And no matter how many crappy, stupid, useless assignments you throw at me, I'm not going to quit and I'm not going to back down. So you can go home tonight and think about the fact that no matter what you do and no matter how evil you are, at the end of the year, on my high school transcript, it's going to say that I worked on The Franklin. So, if you'll excuse me, I have some reading to do on the origins of concrete.
PARIS: A thousand words on my desk on Tuesday.
[Rory walks out of the room and starts walking down the hallway. Max is coming from the other direction. They stop in front of each other, then both turn around and go the other way. Paris watches from the classroom window.]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is wiping a table as Lorelai walks into the diner.]
LORELAI: Hey.
[Luke is startled and spills coffee on the table.]
LUKE: Oh geez.
LORELAI: Sorry.
LUKE: No, I'll justyou want some coffee?
LORELAI: It's okay. I'll just lick it off the table. So?
LUKE: So what?
LORELAI: Is he here?
LUKE: He's here.
LORELAI: Yeah? How is he? [sits at counter]
LUKE: He's fine.
LORELAI: Did he see the bed?
LUKE: He saw the bed.
LORELAI: Well, where is he? I wanna meet him.
LUKE: Oh, he's out.
LORELAI: Out where?
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: You don't?
LUKE: No, he just went out.
LORELAI: You didn't ask him where he was going?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Why not?
LUKE: Because he's not two.
LORELAI: Yeah, but Luke, he's new in town. He doesn't know his way around yet.
LUKE: Way around what? This is Stars Hollow. You take three left turns and you're back in the center of town.
LORELAI: Luke, when a kid goes out, you have to at least ask where he's going.
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: Because you're responsible for him now. If he goes and knocks over a liquor store, it's gonna be your fault.
LUKE: If I had asked him where he was going and he actually intended to knock off a liquor store, do you really think he would've told me that?
LORELAI: If he's dumb.
LUKE: He's fine. New topic.
[Jess walks into the diner]
LUKE: Jess, hey, good. I'd like you to meet someone.
LORELAI: Hey. Hi, I'm Lorelai. I just wanted to meet you before Luke had a chance to fill your head with all kinds of little lies about me.
JESS: Hi.
LORELAI: You know, you should meet my daughter. She's about your age. She can show you where all the good wilding goes on. . . .Okay, well, it's nice to meet you. I hope you like it here. . . . . So, class dismissed.
LUKE: Uh, are you hungry 'cause I can [Jess goes upstairs]
LORELAI: So that's Jess?
LUKE: Yup.
LORELAI: Very chatty.
LUKE: He's adjusting. He just got here. He probably just went out and realized there are twelve stores in this town devoted entirely to peddling porcelain unicorns. I've lived in this town my entire life, I still can't believe it.
LORELAI: I'm sure that's it.
LUKE: He'll be fine in a few days.
LORELAI: Hey, listen, I have a fabulous idea. What are you doing tomorrow night?
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: Why don't you and Jess come over for dinner?
LUKE: Dinner?
LORELAI: Sookie will cook, Rory will be there. It'll be a little 'Hey, welcome to Stars Hollow and see, everyone here's not straight out of a Fellini film' kind of an evening.
LUKE: Okay, that would be nice, thanks.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
LUKE: You won't bring up the bed?
LORELAI: Oh no, I'll definitely bring up the bed.
[Luke walks away. Rory walks in and sits at the counter next to Lorelai.]
RORY: Oh my God, I hate her.
LORELAI: Ah, me too.
RORY: You have no idea who I'm talking about.
LORELAI: Solidarity sister.
RORY: Paris.
LORELAI: Ugh. Well, that I should've guessed.
RORY: She thinks she can torture me off the paper and she can't.
LORELAI: No, she can't.
RORY: I have never met anyone like her before. Her insistence on holding onto this stupid grudge that is based on nothing and will never ever end shows an amount of commitment that I would've never thought possible. I'm beginning to admire her.
LORELAI: First day sucked?
RORY: Just the paper stuff sucked, the rest of the stuff was good.
LORELAI: Good, I'm glad to hear it. Did you happen to run into Max?
RORY: Actually, no.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Yeah, our paths just didn't cross.
LORELAI: Isn't he your Lit teacher?
RORY: Yeah, but I do have really tall people sitting in front of me.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: I saw him in the hallway and I walked the other way and
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: I don't know. I thought that's what you'd want me to do.
LORELAI: Just because Max isn't apart of my life anymore doesn't mean he can't be apart of yours. He has to be apart of yours. You have to see him and talk to him, and that's okay. That's good. I know everything seems screwed up right now, but I don't want you to avoid him, especially not on my account. Okay?
RORY: All right.
LORELAI: I am sorry that I put you in this position.
RORY: That's okay. It's going on the list.
LORELAI: My God, that list is getting long.
RORY: You have no idea.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Rory and Lorelai come out of Luke's and walk down the sidewalk.]
LORELAI: We are having a little gathering tomorrow night.
RORY: What kind of gathering?
LORELAI: Well, Luke's nephew's here, and I thought we could try to make him feel a little more at home.
RORY: Did you meet him?
LORELAI: Sort of.
RORY: What's he like?
LORELAI: Well, he's not gonna be subbing for the new dodo on the Regis show any time soon, let's put in like that.
CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Jess is sitting on his bed smoking and shuffling cards as Luke walks in.]
LUKE: So you get unpacked?
JESS: Yup.
LUKE: Get enough space in the closet?
JESS: Plenty.
LUKE: You hungry?
JESS: Eighteen.
LUKE: What?
JESS: Just counting how many questions 'til we hit twenty.
LUKE: Okay, never mind. [phone rings, Luke answers] Yeah? Yeah, Liz, he got here fine.
JESS: Got here at ten this morning.
LUKE: Okay, hang on a sec. Jess? [holds out the phone]
JESS: Pass.
LUKE: Jess, come on.
JESS: Nope.
LUKE: What am I supposed to tell her?
JESS: Tell her I gotta take another crack at that closet. You know, I think I hung my Tool T-shirt next to my Metallica T-shirt and they don't really get along.
LUKE: You really want me to tell her that?
JESS: You think a different band combo would sell it more?
LUKE: [on phone] Yeah, Liz, Jess is gonna have to call you back. Yeah, he's helping me out with a shelf thing and his hand are fullYeah, I'll tell him. Okay, bye. [hangs up] She said to tell you that your stuff will be here on Friday.
JESS: Great, we'll have a party.
LUKE: You know, your mom thinks this is. . .you know, for the best and for your own good and. . . Anyhow, I guess you'll just call her when you feel like it.
JESS: You wanna play some poker? Five bucks a hand?
LUKE: No.
JESS: Ten?
LUKE: No.
JESS: I can't go any higher than ten.
LUKE: Jess.
JESS: Okay, fifteen
LUKE: Yeah, I don't wanna play poker.
JESS: You sure?
LUKE: I'm sure.
JESS: Okie dokie.
LUKE: So, listen, Lorelai - you met her today, remember? Anyhow, um, she invited us to her house tomorrow night for dinner. Her daughter Rory, who you didn't meet but you'll like 'cause she's a lot like Lorelai, but she's got a slightly tighter grasp on reality. Anyhow, she'll be there, and you know, it'd be aI don't know, it'd be a chance for you to meet more people and so I, I said yes.
[Jess grabs his coat and walks out.]
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory is sitting alone at the table waiting for the newspaper meeting to start. Paris walks in.]
PARIS: Oh, hello.
RORY: Hi.
PARIS: You're early.
RORY: Yeah, well I felt so bad about the mix up last time, I wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. It won't.
[Other students walk in for the meeting and sit at the table.]
MADELINE: Hey, did you hear that Kimber Slately and Tristin are a major item?
LOUISE: I thought that Kimber and Shawn Asher were this year's John and Jackie.
MADELINE: Nope, Shawn is with Deeds McGuire now, which pushed Jeff Trainer into Dottie Lords' arms leaving Madison Maylands alone for the first weekend since he became captain of the lacrosse team.
LOUISE: Wow, you know so much so soon. You have a gift.
MADELINE: I know. Hey Paris, what do you think about me writing a gossip column for The Franklin?
PARIS: Huh. I don't know. That's a hard one. I mean, this is The Franklin, a newspaper that's been around for almost a hundred years. There have been at least ten former editors of The Franklin that have gone on to work at the New York Times. Six have gone onto the Washington Post. Three are contributing editors at the New Yorker. I think one even went on to win the Pullitzer Prize. But never mind them. I could be the first editor in the history of The Franklin to introduce a column exclusively devoted to who Biffy's boffing today. Quandary. You know, I'm gonna have to get back to you on that one.
MADELINE: Okay.
TEACHER: Oh good, we're all here. And prompt, lovely. Well, I've read everyone's article, and they were all extremely well done. Snappy, informative, well-researched. Paris, you should be very proud of the team you've assembled here this year.
PARIS: Thank you.
TEACHER: I mean, when you've got a reporter who can take an incredibly mundane and seemingly unimportant subject like the re-paving of the faculty parking lot and turn it into a bittersweet piece on how everybody and everything eventually becomes obsolete, then you've really got something. Miss Gilmore, I was touched.
RORY: I owe it all to Paris.
TEACHER: I would strongly advise that next time you give Miss Gilmore something with a little more meat to it.
PARIS: Oh, yeah, great idea.
TEACHER: Okay, let's get down to work here. We've got a layout to put together.
[Rory walks to a computer and sits down. Paris walks over to her.]
PARIS: Well, congratulations.
RORY: Thank you.
PARIS: You must be very proud of yourself.
RORY: Well, I'm not hiding when I pass a mirror.
PARIS: I guess it's part of my job as editor to make sure that our best writer's are writing our best pieces, so I'm going to give you one of our best pieces.
RORY: Uh huh.
PARIS: Front page, lead story, above the fold.
RORY: Get to the catch Paris.
PARIS: No catch.
RORY: No catch?
PARIS: I'd like to start out year off with a profile on the teacher voted most popular from the year before. You know, an in-depth, no holds barred interview. Everybody wants it. You have it.
RORY: You're kidding.
PARIS: Nope.
RORY: Well, thanks.
PARIS: You're welcome. So go ahead and set up that interview with Mr. Medina as soon as possible.
RORY: What?
PARIS: I know it's short notice but I'd love it to lead off the first edition.
RORY: Mr. Medina?
PARIS: He was the winner by a landslide.
RORY: But
PARIS: I'm sorry, is there a problem? I mean, is there some reason why you wouldn't want to interview him? After all, you of all people should be able to get the most in-depth story out of him, especially since he and your mother are involved. They are still involved, aren't they?
RORY: Let's just leave my mother's personal life out of this, okay?
PARIS: Oh, that sounds bad.
RORY: It's not bad, it's just none of your business.
PARIS: Fine. You want the interview or not?
RORY: Yes, I want the interview.
PARIS: Good. Get me something more than his favorite color, okay?
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Sookie and Jackson are in the kitchen cooking.]
SOOKIE: Maybe I should make grilled cheese.
JACKSON: But you're making pot roast.
SOOKIE: But not everybody likes pot roast.
JACKSON: Well, then they can have the chicken wings, the mashed potatoes, the four different kinds of salad that you're making in addition to the pot roast.
SOOKIE: Yeah, I guess you're right.
JACKSON: So I should start slicing the cheese?
SOOKIE: Would you? Oh, that'd be great.
[Lorelai walks into the kitchen.]
LORELAI: Oh, wow, something smells good.
SOOKIE: It's the garlic.
JACKSON: Three heads of it.
LORELAI: Nice.
SOOKIE: I want everything to be perfect. We are gonna make this kid think that he died and went to heaven.
JACKSON: Or Henry the Eighth's house.
[Lorelai knocks on Rory's bedroom door.]
LORELAI: Milady?
RORY: Come in.
[Lorelai opens the door, Rory is sitting at her computer.]
LORELAI: Hey, you joining the festivities?
RORY: In a sec.
LORELAI: You sound crabby.
RORY: I'm concentrating.
LORELAI: Okay, don't concentrate too hard. Boys like 'em dumb, right Jackson?
JACKSON: If you can navigate yourself around a tree, keep on walking.
[There's a knock at the front door]
LORELAI: Coming!
SOOKIE: What if he doesn't do dairy?
CUT TO FRONT HALLWAY
[Lorelai opens the front door, Luke and Jess are standing there.]
LORELAI: Hey, perfect timing. Sookie's about to break her own record for the most food served outside the Roman Empire.
LUKE: Sounds great.
JESS: Sure does.
LORELAI: So, come on in.
[They walk inside. Jess goes into the living as Luke and Lorelai keep talking in the hallway.]
LUKE: Sorry we're a little late. We had a little misunderstanding about what time we're actually supposed to leave to come here.
LORELAI: It's okay. How's it going?
LUKE: Oh, well, not bad. Oh, the bed popped.
LORELAI: Yikes. Was anyone in it?
LUKE: Me.
LORELAI: You?
LUKE: Yeah, I let him take the real one.
LORELAI: Well, that was very nice of you. Hey Jess. Wanna come on in the kitchen?
CUT TO KITCHEN
LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson, I want you to meet Luke's nephew. This is Jess.
SOOKIE: Do you eat cheese?
JESS: What?
JACKSON: Oh my God, this is the greatest lemon I have ever grown. I mean, this is a great lemon. Sookie, you gotta try this lemon. Isn't it a great lemon?
SOOKIE: That is a great lemon.
JACKSON: Try it, it's a Meyer.
LORELAI: Jackson grows fruit and then scares people with it. Rory, they're here.
RORY: Coming. [sees Jess] Hey.
JESS: Hey. [walks into Rory's room]
RORY: I'm Rory.
JESS: Yeah, I figured.
RORY: Nice to meet you.
JESS: [looking at bookshelf] Wow, aren't we hooked on phonics.
RORY: Oh, I read a lot. Do you read?
JESS: Not much. [takes a book off the shelf]
RORY: I could loan you that if you want. It's great.
JESS: No thanks. [puts it down]
RORY: Well, if you change your mind
LORELAI: [from the doorway] Okay, we really need to get Jackson away from the lemons now, so we're moving the feast in the living room. [walks away]
RORY: Be right there.
JESS: So do these open? [looking at windows]
RORY: Oh yeah, you just have to unlatch them and then push.
JESS: Great. Shall we?
RORY: Shall we what?
JESS: Bail.
RORY: No.
JESS: Why?
RORY: Because it's Tuesday night in Stars Hollow. There's nowhere to bail to. The 24-hour mini-mart just closed twenty minutes ago.
JESS: So we'll walk around or sit on a bench and stare at our shoes.
RORY: Look, Sookie just made a ton of really great food, and I'm starving and though it may not seem like it right at this moment, it's gonna be fun. Trust me.
JESS: I don't even know you.
RORY: Well, don't I look trustworthy?
JESS: Maybe.
RORY: Okay, good. Let's eat. [walks into kitchen] You want a soda?
JESS: Oh, I'll get it.
RORY: Okay.
[Rory gets a soda and walks into the living room. Jess walks to the fridge, takes out a beer, and goes out the back door.]
CUT TO LIVING ROOM
[A table is set up in the living room. Everyone stands around it loading up their plates.]
SOOKIE: You know ham was originally made out of rice?
JACKSON: What?
SOOKIE: Mm hmm.
LORELAI: Sookie
LUKE: Hey Rory, where's Jess?
RORY: He's getting a soda.
LORELAI: Here. [hands Luke a plate]
LUKE: I'm sorry, you must've mistaken me for you.
LORELAI: Ooh, too much?
SOOKIE: Oh, I forgot the garlic bread.
LORELAI: I'll get it.
CUT TO KITCHEN
[Lorelai walks in, takes the bread out of the oven, then looks around for Jess. She walks out the back door.]
CUT TO BACK PORCH
[Lorelai walks out and finds Jess opening the beer.]
LORELAI: Oh, for me, hey, thanks. [takes a sip] Refreshing. So what, you're not hungry?
JESS: Not really.
LORELAI: Well, Sookie made you some grilled cheese if you don't like pot roast.
JESS: Oh, well, if I'd had known that
LORELAI: Let me guess, you don't want to be here?
JESS: Doesn't matter.
LORELAI: I mean, here in Stars Hollow.
JESS: Well geez, Ms. Gilmore, why would anyone not want to be here in Stars Hollow? That just sounds plum crazy.
LORELAI: Ugh, Jess, let me give you a little advice. The whole 'my parents don't get me' thing, I've been there.
JESS: You have, huh?
LORELAI: Yes, I have. I've also done the 'chip on my shoulder' bit. Ooh, and the surly, sarcastic, 'the world can bite my ass' bit, and let me tell you, I mastered them all, in heels, yet. And everything you're feeling might be totally justified, maybe you are getting screwed. But Luke is a great guy. He's very special, and he really wants to take care of you and make things right for you. You're incredibly lucky to have him. If you give this situation half a chance, you might be surprised at how good it can be, how much you like living here, and how comfortable it feels to have someone like Luke you can really depend on.
JESS: What are you sleeping with him or something?
LORELAI: Excuse me?
JESS: I don't know. The whole starry eyed 'you're so much better off, just give it a chance' speech. You're either really naïve, or you're getting some.
LORELAI: Ugh. There have been very few moments in my life where I have actually wished I had one of those enormous cream pies you can just smash in someone's face, but this is definitely one of them.
JESS: Well, now, that's not very neighborly.
LORELAI: Hey, you know what, this is my house, and I choose how I get talked to in it, ha ha.
JESS: You know, you don't know anything about me, or my life, or my mom, or Luke, so why don't you Doctor Laura someone else.
LORELAI: I'm going inside, stay out of my fridge.
CUT TO KITCHEN
[Lorelai walks in from the back door and starts putting the garlic bread in a basket. Luke walks in.]
LUKE: Where's Jess?
LORELAI: Outside working on his "Breakfast Club" audition. He's getting good.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Luke, I'm sorry. That kid is way more screwed up than you think he is.
LUKE: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: I catch him outside with a beer, I don't even bust him on it, I justI try talking to him
LUKE: What do you mean, talk to him? What did you say?
LORELAI: I said he's got a good thing going here with you and he shouldn't blow it, and then, well then he just got charming.
LUKE: What are you doing talking to him about stuff like that?
LORELAI: I'm trying to help you.
LUKE: I don't need your help.
LORELAI: Uh, yeah you do.
LUKE: Oh, here we go again with this 'I'm not prepared for this' crap.
LORELAI: This is not crap, this is the truth. Luke, you should've heard him talking.
LUKE: I don't need to hear him talking, he's my nephew and I know what I'm doing. And I'm getting a little tired of your condescending
LORELAI: I am not being condescending.
LUKE: Oh, you have a kid, so you know everything, right?
LORELAI: I have a kid, so yeah, I know a little more than you do.
LUKE: You know, you ever think maybe you just got lucky with Rory? I mean, you did get pregnant at sixteen. That doesn't show the greatest decision making skills, now does it?
LORELAI: Wow, two pies.
LUKE: What the hell you talking about?
LORELAI: Nothing. I'm talking about nothing. And you won't have to hear my opinion on anything ever again, okay?
LUKE: Oh, don't tease.
LORELAI: Go find Jess. [walks away]
LUKE: Don't tell me what to do. [goes out the back door]
CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S DINER
[Rory are Lorelai are standing in front of the diner.]
RORY: You're being completely childish.
LORELAI: Am not.
RORY: So what, we're never gonna go into Luke's again? We're just gonna starve?
LORELAI: Rory, this was a bad one, okay? This was not Nick and Nora, this was Sid and Nancy, and I'm not going in there.
RORY: But the coffee is in there. And it's Danish Day. Are you seriously telling me that you're gonna let a stupid fight get in the way of Danish Day?
LORELAI: No, I'm not.
RORY: Good.
LORELAI: So go in there and order two coffees and two Danishes to go.
RORY: You're kidding, right?
LORELAI: And don't forget the napkins.
RORY: Mom, he's gonna know what's going on. He's not stupid.
LORELAI: He cannot prove that you're not ordering all that for yourself, can he? No, so go on. Scoot, scoot. Mommy's right here.
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S
[Rory walks up to Luke at the counter.]
RORY: Hey Luke.
LUKE: Rory.
RORY: Um, I'll have two coffees and two cherry Danishes to go, please.
LUKE: Two coffees and two cherry Danishes.
RORY: Oh, and some napkins.
LUKE: One of these is for her isn't it?
RORY: Who? Oh, no no no. They're all for me. I am super hungry today. I was debating ordering three, but I'll tell you how I feel after two.
LUKE: Tell you what, I'll give you one Danish and one cup of coffee, you can sit over there and eat, and when you're finished them right over there where I can see you, then I'll bring you a second one.
RORY: You're really just gonna stand there and watch me eat a Danish?
LUKE: Cable's out. I'm starved for entertainment.
RORY: Okay, this is insane. So you guys had a fight, big deal. You know you're gonna make up anyway, and what better day to make up than Danish Day, the happiest of all days. The day when we all say, 'hey, let's forgive and forget over a nice Danish and a cup coffee.'
LUKE: One Danish, one cup of coffee, take it or leave it.
RORY: I'll take it. I still think you're being silly.
[Luke hands her a cup of coffee and a paper bag.]
LUKE: Thank you for sharing. Come back soon.
CUT TO FRONT OF DINER
[Rory walks out carrying the bag and the coffee and walks over to Lorelai.]
LORELAI: Well?
RORY: He would only sell me one.
LORELAI: Ugh! Didn't you say they were both for you?
RORY: Yes I did, and he knew that I was lying.
LORELAI: Did you do the blinky thing? You always do the blinky thing when you're lying.
RORY: I didn't have to do the blinky thing. He knows you well enough to know that you're not gonna go a whole day with no coffee and especially no Danish.
LORELAI: Ugh!
RORY: Why don't you go in there now and just make up?
LORELAI: Why don't you give me half your Danish and some coffee?
RORY: I'll give you the Danish but I'm keeping the coffee.
LORELAI: What is a Danish without coffee?
RORY: The eternal question springs up again.
LORELAI: There's no point in even eating a Danish without coffee.
RORY: I'm going to school.
LORELAI: Sad Danish, lonely Danish, step Danish.
RORY: I'll see you tonight. [walks away]
LORELAI: But [sees a little boy crossing the street] Hey, kid, do me a favor? Come here.
[Luke watches through the window as Lorelai tries to get the kid to buy her coffee.]
LORELAI: Please, please
[the kid runs away, Lorelai looks at the diner and pouts. The phone rings in the diner; Luke answers]
LUKE: Luke'swhat is it Taylor? Slow down, you're babbling. Well, how do you know it was Jess? . . . Okay, Taylor, I'll talk to him, but if he tells me he didn't do it and nobody saw him do it, then he is off the hook, understand? [hangs up]
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory walks down the hallway and stops in front of a door. She pauses a second before walking inside. Inside the classroom, Max is sitting at a desk.]
RORY: Hi.
MAX: Rory, hi.
RORY: Am I too early? 'Cause I can
MAX: No, no.
RORY: come back some other time.
MAX: This is fine.
RORY: Tomorrow maybe.
MAX: Now is good.
RORY: This is weird.
MAX: Yeah, it is.
RORY: I don't really know how to act.
MAX: I'm not completely sure of that myself. We could sit.
RORY: Sit, sure, that's good. Barbara Walters sits, or walks sometimes if the person she's talking to has a horse or a ranch or a big backyard sometimes, but usually she just sits. Okay, so I guess we should just start. [she sits across from him]
MAX: Good idea.
RORY: Do you mind if I tape this?
MAX: Oh, no, not at all.
RORY: Okay. [turns on tape recorder] So I guess I'll just dive in. Full name?
MAX: Max Arturo Medina.
RORY: You're kidding.
MAX: No, I'm not.
RORY: Where does that come from?
MAX: My father's butcher was named Arturo.
RORY: Really?
MAX: And when my mother was pregnant with me, she went through this phase where all she would eat was lamb chops. So Arturo would cut her the extra large lamb chops and only charge her for the regular sized lamb chops, which in my family made you eligible for sainthood.
RORY: Hence the Arturo.
MAX: That's right.
RORY: Well, I assume that you are aware that you were overwhelmingly voted the student's favorite teacher last year.
MAX: I teach an exceptional bunch of young people. I'm glad they seem to like me as much as I like them.
RORY: Have you ever thought of doing something other than teaching?
MAX: Well, my father wanted me to be a doctor, and my mother wanted me to be President, and I wanted to be. . . a clown.
RORY: What?
MAX: When I was a kid, I went to the circus and I saw this man who was dressed in this crazy outfit, and he could juggle and he rode on an elephant and the people loved him and I thought, 'Well, that's it. That's for me.'
RORY: How long did that last?
MAX: Junior high. And then slowly I figured out that I wanted to teach. Plus, when you told people that you wanted to be a clown they tended to get very frightened.
RORY: Mom took me to the circus once, when I was really little and, um, this clown knocked into me and I dropped my cotton candy, and we didn't have a lot of money back then so she couldn't buy me another one, and I started crying. So she literally chased the clown on stage, ripped off his wig and said she wouldn't give it back to him unless he bought me another cotton candy.
MAX: Which I bet he did.
RORY: It was twice as big as the first one and I threw up all the way home.
MAX: Yeah, that sounds like your mom.
RORY: Do you ever regret the fact that you didn't become a clown?
MAX: I don't really believe in regrets. All my experiences, even the ones that didn't turn out the way I wanted them to, I firmly believe they were all worth it.
[Rory turns off the tape recorder]
RORY: I just want you to know, I really wanted you to be my stepfather.
MAX: I just want you to know, I really wanted to be your stepfather.
[They're silent for a few seconds, then Rory turns back on tape recorder.]
RORY: So, what would you say are the great challenges facing high school graduates today?
MAX: Well, a myriad of things really
CUT TO OUTSIDE STARS HOLLOW HIGH
[Luke is waiting out front as Jess walks out.]
LUKE: Hey. How was school?
JESS: Great.
LUKE: You learn anything good?
JESS: Oh yeah, tons of things. I've got gold stars plastered all over my forehead.
LUKE: I had an interesting call today. Wanna know who it was from?
JESS: Not really.
LUKE: It was from Taylor Doose, you know he owns the market.
JESS: If you say so.
LUKE: He said you came in today.
JESS: He did?
LUKE: And he said you took some money out of a little donation cup to help repair the bridge. I told him he was crazy, you wouldn't do that, you weren't a thief, that he was just trying to start trouble, then I hung up on him. But don't get me wrong, I enjoy hanging up on Taylor, and he is crazy, but I was just wondering if maybe any of the other things he said were true.
JESS: What do you think?
LUKE: I think that if you tell me that what he's saying is not true, then I'm gonna believe it's not true.
JESS: Okay, it's not true.
LUKE: That doesn't sound very convincing.
JESS: Look, what exactly do you want from me? You bring me here to this place, you put me in a school that says the Pledge of Allegiance in six different languages, two of which I've never heard of before. You take me away from my home, my friends, and now you want what from me?
LUKE: I'm trying to help you.
JESS: Well, stop trying. Stop talking to me, stop following me, and stop asking me questions. Just stop.
LUKE: That's what you want?
JESS: Yes.
LUKE: That's really what you want?
JESS: Yes.
LUKE: Fine, you got it.
JESS: Thank you.
LUKE: You're welcome.
[As they both walk away over a bridge, Luke pushes Jess into the lake.]
CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN
[Rory's sitting at the kitchen table doing homework as Lorelai comes home.]
LORELAI: Rory?
RORY: Kitchen.
[Lorelai walks into the kitchen and takes a bag of coffee from the fridge]
LORELAI: Nowhere in either Stars Hollow or it's surrounding counties can you get a decent cup of coffee. I swear, it's like a big stupid coffee conspiracy.
RORY: Why don't you just pour the water right into the bag?
LORELAI: Oh, you jest, but believe me, the thought has crossed my mind. It's looking better and better all the time. Where are you going? I'm not through complaining.
RORY: I just have to get some more notes I need.
LORELAI: Hmm. What's this?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: This that you're working on?
RORY: Oh, that's my interview with Max.
LORELAI: What interview with Max?
RORY: The paper wanted to do a piece on the student's favorite teacher from the previous year and Paris assigned it to me when she caught wind of the fact that. . .
LORELAI: Wow, nice kid that Paris.
RORY: Yeah. It wasn't that bad though.
LORELAI: No?
RORY: No. It was actually good. It gave us a chance to talk about some things.
LORELAI: Well good.
RORY: Yeah, it was good. Well, I'm gonna buy a folder for it before the store closes.
LORELAI: Okay. Some good writing here, missy.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Really good.
RORY: It's not quite up to the re-paving piece yet but I'll get it there.
LORELAI: Hmm. Boy, he sounds like a hell of a guy, doesn't he?
RORY: Yeah, he does. [leaves]
LORELAI: I sure know how to dump 'em, don't I?
[there's a knock at the back door; Lorelai opens it, Luke walks in.]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: I just pushed him in a lake.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Jess. I got this call from Taylor that he thinks Jess stole the bridge money and I went to confront him and he was being impossible and I just pushed him in a lake. This is bad.
LORELAI: That depends, can he swim?
LUKE: He's fine. He's wet. I just, I lost it, you know. You were right. I am in so far over my head that I can't see my own hat.
LORELAI: Try turning it around
LUKE: What was I thinking? Why did I say yes to this?
LORELAI: Because you saw a kid in desperate need of some help and you thought you would throw him a line.
LUKE: But me, raising a kid? I don't even like kids. They're always sticky, you know, like they've got jam on their hands. Even if there's no jam in the house, somehow they've always got jam on their hands. I'm not the right guy to deal with that. I have no patience for jam hands.
LORELAI: Luke, slow down. First of all, Jess is seventeen, so I think he's probably past the jam hands stage by now. And second of all, you can do this. If you want to, you are totally capable. But you can't just buy a bed and some sheets and expect the rest to take care of itself. That will not work.
LUKE: I swear, I'm gonna k*ll Liz.
LORELAI: Hey, Liz is not the point anymore. Liz is not here, Jess is here. Focus on him. What are you gonna do about him?
[Babette walks in the back door.]
BABETTE: Lorelai, sugah? I hate to bother you, but have you seen Pierpont?
LORELAI: Um no. Why?
BABETTE: It's the darndest thing. I came out just now and I noticed that he was gone. Just like that.
LUKE: I'm sorry, who's missing?
BABETTE: Pierpont, gorgeous.
LORELAI: Her gnome.
LUKE: Her gnome?
BABETTE: The one with the pipe.
LUKE: Oh.
BABETTE: Oh God, I hope nothing's happened to him. You get so attached to their little faces, sometimes you can hear them talk to you at night.
LUKE: You know, I wouldn't worry Babette. I think you're gonna see Pierpont again really soon. [walks to the front door]
LORELAI: Oh, where you going?
LUKE: I have to take care of something. I'll see you tomorrow at the diner for your Danish, right?
LORELAI: Tomorrow isn't Danish Day.
LUKE: Just be there.
LORELAI: Yes, sir.
CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Jess is on his bed smoking; Luke walks in with a bag and starts dropping things on his bed.]
LUKE: Okay, we got the patch, the gum, hypnosis tapes, Chinese herbs, self-help books, and several pictures of diseased lungs to hang on the fridge. Pretty, huh? This is done. [puts out his cigarette]
JESS: Hey!
LUKE: You will get up, you will go to school, you will come home, you will work in the diner until closing, you will do your homework and then you will go to bed. Where's the gnome?
JESS: The what?
LUKE: The weekends are for chores and selected pre-approved outings, i.e. cavalla studies, freeway beautification projects, Color Me Mine pottery painting, all discussible options. You will not steal, you will pay back Taylor Doose, you will graduate for high school, and you will return Pierpont to his yard.
JESS: You can't just
LUKE: I can just. I am not letting you just fall off the face of the earth. You will not drift, I won't let it happen. Now I don't know if this is the right way to handle this, but this is the way it's being handled, and that my friend, is the end of this discussion. [Jess gets up and walks away] Where are you going?
JESS: Out. [leaves]
LUKE: Well, at least I asked.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Jess is walking down the street and sees Rory come out of a store. He walks over to her.]
JESS: Hey.
RORY: Hey yourself.
JESS: What are you doing out here?
RORY: I needed something for school. What about you?
JESS: Oh yeah, same thing.
RORY: Uh huh. So, that was quite a disappearing act you pulled the other night.
JESS: Potlucks and Tupperware parties aren't really my thing.
RORY: Too cool for school, huh?
JESS: Yes, that is me.
RORY: What are you doing?
JESS: Oh this? Nothing. [does an illusion with a coin] Just another little disappearing act.
RORY: Little tip?
JESS: Yeah?
RORY: If you ever want to speak to me again, don't pull that out of my ear.
JESS: So I assume the nose is off limits too?
RORY: Any place you wouldn't naturally find a coin, let's leave it that way.
JESS: So what are you doing now?
RORY: I have some homework to finish.
JESS: Okay, then I'll leave you this last little trick. [hands her a book]
RORY: You bought a copy? I told you I'd lend you mine.
JESS: It is yours.
RORY: You stole my book.
JESS: Nope, borrowed it.
RORY: Okay, that's not called a trick, that's called a felony.
JESS: I just wanted to put some notes in the margins for you.
RORY: What? [looks through the book] You've read this before.
JESS: About forty times.
RORY: I thought you said you didn't read much.
JESS: Well, what is much? Goodnight Rory.
RORY: Goodnight Dodger.
JESS: Dodger?
RORY: Figure it out.
JESS: Oliver Twist.
[Rory smiles and nods. They both walk away.]

transcript by Stacy
OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[The doorbell rings, the maid answers it; Lorelai and Rory are standing there.]
MAID: Yes?
LORELAI: Hey.
MAID: Hello.
LORELAI: You're new.
MAID: Uh, I started yesterday.
LORELAI: What's your name?
MAID: Liesl.
LORELAI: Okay, Liesl. I'm Brigitta, this is Gretl. And, uh, Emily and Richard are expecting us.
LIESL: Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.
[Lorelai and Rory walk inside; they hear Emily and Richard arguing upstairs.]
LIESL: Uh, can I, uh, get you a drink?
LORELAI: You know what, that's okay. I can get it. Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?
LIESL: Really? Thank you. [walks away]
RORY: What is going on?
LORELAI: I don't know. I think George and Martha are joining us for dinner.
[Lorelai and Rory watch Emily and Richard fighting on the steps.]
RICHARD: I didn't know that my every conversation needed to be reported to you. I stand corrected.
EMILY: I have been the co-chair of the Starlight Foundation for the last eight years.
RICHARD: I know this, Emily.
EMILY: And the Black and White Ball is the main fundraising event of the season.
RICHARD: It's one year.
EMILY: The co-chair cannot miss the main fundraising event.
RICHARD: Why? Won't the chair be there?
EMILY: Is this a joke to you?
RICHARD: Emily, I have too many things to take care of at work. I don't have time for frivolous parties.
EMILY: Frivolous parties? Friv. . . .[walks up the steps]
RICHARD: Well, where are you going? Oh, come back here. [follows her]
RORY: Wow, this is bad.
LORELAI: I know, I wish we had popcorn.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Shh. Incoming.
[Emily and Richard come back down the steps. Emily reads from a stack of invitations.]
EMILY: The Hartford Zoological Silent Auction, the Mark Twain House Restoration Fund luncheon, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Literacy Auction.
RICHARD: I can read those myself, you know.
EMILY: This is the fourth event you've taken upon yourself to turn down on our behalf. And I am on the board of all of those foundations. Now how do you think that makes me look?
RICHARD: Like your husband is busy and has a great deal of responsibility.
EMILY: Well, I have responsibilities too.
RICHARD: I understand that your social engagements are important.
EMILY: They're not just social engagements.
RICHARD: Anything at which you serve tea is a social engagement.
EMILY: That's it. I am gonna get a tape recorder so you can hear how pompous and condescending you sound.
RICHARD: Wha...uh...Emily.
EMILY: No, I wouldn't want you to take my word for it. I might be delirious from all that tea I've been drinking. [walks upstairs]
RICHARD: Oh stop this. [follows her]
RORY: Maybe we should leave.
LORELAI: Are you kidding? We've got dinner theater here.
RORY: But Grandma and Grandpa are obviously in a fight.
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: One that they probably wouldn't want us to see.
LORELAI: Hey, we stumbled in here completely innocently. We came for dinner as usual, per their request. We had no idea we were walking into The Lion King without the puppet heads.
[They come back downstairs. Emily follows Richard holding out a tape recorder.]
RICHARD: Get that thing out of my face.
EMILY: Just say the tea thing again.
RICHARD: You are behaving like a child.
EMILY: Turn around when you talk, would you? I'm not sure how good this microphone is.
RICHARD: [sees Lorelai and Rory] Oh.
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: [claps] Brava! Encore! I'm sorry, does Terrence McNally know about you too? Get me the phone!
[opening credits]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter. Lorelai is reading Rory's homework.]
RORY: It sucks. I know it sucks, just tell me it sucks.
LORELAI: It's great.
RORY: No it's not.
LORELAI: It's an A.
RORY: Don't lie.
LORELAI: A-plus.
RORY: You're my mom.
LORELAI: Is anything higher than an A-plus?
RORY: You have to say that.
LORELAI: It's an A-plus with a crown and a wand.
RORY: This is not how you raise a child. You don't send them out there with a false sense of pride because out there, in the real world, no one will coddle you. I'd rather know right now if I'm gonna be working at CNN or carrying a basket around it's offices with sandwiches in it.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: It's great.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Really really.
RORY: Thank you.
[Luke walks over and fills their mugs.]
LUKE: Coffeecoffee. Okay, what do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?
LORELAI: What's the rush there, Zippy?
LUKE: I'm just swamped this morning. I was supposed to have help but I don't. So order right now or I'm bringing the both of you an egg white omelet with a side of steamed spinach.
LORELAI: Pancakes.
RORY: French toast.
LUKE: Thank you. [Jess walks into the diner from the stairway] Jess, you were supposed to be down here. . . .what the hell is that?
JESS: What?
LUKE: That.
JESS: That is a shirt.
LUKE: Change.
JESS: What?
LUKE: Go upstairs and change your shirt.
JESS: I like this shirt.
LUKE: How can you like that shirt?
JESS: It brings out my eyes.
LUKE: Hey, part of the deal of you staying here is that you work here, and when you work here you will wear proper work attire, and that is not proper work attire. Now go upstairs and change into something that won't scare the hell out of my customers.
JESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke. [goes upstairs]
LORELAI: Gross shirt.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Good band.
RORY: Oh yeah.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Emily is having tea on the back patio with three friends.]
EMILY: Thank you.
MAID: Mm hmm. [walks away]
LADY 1: Another new one, Emily?
EMILY: Yes. The last one only made it through one evening. Thoroughly nervous creature.
LADY 2: What do you do to them, Em?
EMILY: Oh, the usual. Clean this, cook that, sacrifice a virgin on your way out.
LADY 1: [laughs] The things you say.
LADY 2: We could've done with some of that at the ball the other night.
EMILY: Why, was it dull?
LADY 2: I felt as if my shoes were going out of style as I sat there.
EMILY: What a shame.
LADY 3: Now, Nattie, it wasn't all dull. Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?
NATTIE: Oh, that's right.
EMILY: What, what about Truly Bishop?
LADY 3: Well, you know she and Eugene split up last month.
EMILY: What?
NATTIE: Oh Em! You knew about that. They had this huge fight at the. . oh that's right, you missed the Schafer's cocktail party.
EMILY: They broke up at the Schafer's cocktail party?
NATTIE: He has another family in Salisbury.
EMILY: No!
LADY 3: She's 26, with a 2 year old.
EMILY: How did Truly find out?
NATTIE: The little tart sent her a letter.
EMILY: Oh my God.
LADY 1: So Truly confronted Eugene after consuming a bottle and a half of Cristal, and he admitted it. He said he was going to leave her and marry the Salisbury concubine.
EMILY: What did she do?
LADY 1: She threw an ice sculpture at his head.
EMILY: I can't believe I missed that.
LADY 1: You've missed everything lately.
LADY 3: Yes, where have you been? Is everything all right?
EMILY: Yes, it's just, uh, Richard.
NATTIE: He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury, has he?
EMILY: No, he's been swamped at work. Night and day, weekends. You'd think he was the only person who worked at that company. Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well. His back and knees. Very bad knees. [Sees Rory at the patio doorway] Oh Rory, what a nice surprise.
RORY: Hey Grandma. Sorry to butt in like this.
EMILY: Nonsense, come and meet my friends. Ladies, I'd like you to meet my granddaughter Rory.
LADY 3: Well, hello Rory.
RORY: Nice to meet you.
NATTIE: My goodness, what a pretty girl you are.
LADY 1: She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?
NATTIE: The eyes.
LADY 3: The nose.
LADY 1: Walk around sweetie.
EMILY: Sally, leave the girl alone.
LADY 1: I just wanna see the walk. Lorelai had such a specific walk.
LADY 3: Fast.
LADY 1: That was it.
EMILY: Come, sit, would you like some tea?
RORY: Oh, no. I just came to pick up a book that Grandpa was supposed to leave for me.
EMILY: Go check his study. It might be on his desk.
RORY: Okay, thanks. [walks inside]
LADY 3: Emily, your granddaughter is just lovely. How old is she?
EMILY: Sixteen.
LADY 3: Sixteen, that's a nice age.
LADY 1: So, have you thought about her debut?
EMILY: Oh, uh, no, not yet.
LADY 3: Well you know, the Daughters of the Daughters of the American Revolution Debutante Ball is next week.
EMILY: It is? I hadn't realized.
LADY 3: Why don't you present Rory there?
EMILY: Oh. . uh. . Well, I don't know. Isn't it a little late?
LADY 1: Oh please. For Emily Gilmore, I'm sure they'll bend the rules.
LADY 3: Oh you have to. With a girl like that Emily, you'll be the hit of the ball.
NATTIE: She'd definitely be the prettiest one there.
LADY 1: Except for Katie Heathington.
LADY 3: No, didn't you hear? Katie fell off her horse, has a scab on her face.
NATTIE: Oh, well then, if Katie Heathington has a scab on her face, Rory will definitely be the prettiest one there.
LADY 3: It'll be your crowning moment.
[Rory returns with the book]
RORY: I found it. [pause] Yay.
CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN
[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table doing homework as Rory comes home.]
RORY: I'm coming out.
LORELAI: Out of what?
RORY: Out into society.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
RORY: I went to Grandma's house after school.
LORELAI: Okay, right away, bad.
RORY: And, um, her DAR friends are all there and they're talking about this debutante ball that's being thrown.
LORELAI: Oh no.
RORY: And when I got back from Grandpa's office, they all invited me out onto the patio.
LORELAI: No no no, please tell me you did not go out onto the patio.
RORY: I went out onto the patio.
LORELAI: Ugh, Rory, that's like accepting the position as the drummer in Spinal Tap.
RORY: Before I knew it, Grandma was telling me how important it is for a person to be properly presented to society.
LORELAI: Ugh.
RORY: And how every young girl dreams of this day.
LORELAI: Agh.
RORY: And how there are flowers.
LORELAI: Oh Lord.
RORY: And music.
LORELAI: Please.
RORY: And cake.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, the cake's actually good.
RORY: And before I knew it, Grandma was bringing out your old dress and I was trying it on and. . . what are you doing?
LORELAI: I'm getting you out of this. [picks up phone]
RORY: Mom, wait.
LORELAI: I swear, there is nothing in the world my mother is better at than getting someone to agree to something that in any other universe, they would never ever consider.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: I am still convinced she had something to do with Lily Tomlin doing that movie with John Travolta.
RORY: I'm doing this.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Because you should've seen the look on Grandma's face when she asked me. It's just really really important to her.
LORELAI: But. . .
RORY: Now if it's that important to her, and it's not that important to me, then why shouldn't I do it?
LORELAI: Rory, do you now what a coming out party says?
RORY: It says I'm a woman now.
LORELAI: No. It says, 'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding and marriageable age, and I will now parade around in front of young men of similarly good breeding and marriageable age so they can all take a good long look at me.'
RORY: You're exaggerating.
LORELAI: No, it's like animals being up for bid at the county fair, except sheep don't wear hoop skirts.
RORY: Look, I promised, but you don't have to be apart of it if you don't want to.
LORELAI: No, no, if you wanna do it, I'll help. It's just weird. This is all the stuff I ran away from. I just assumed you'd be running with me.
RORY: Well, I would, but I heard debutantes don't run. Something about the heels.
LORELAI: All right then. If you're sure, where do we start? Uh, let's see. Well, you have a dress. You need a dowry, I guess. There you go. And uh, you'll need shoes, hose, gloves, some mice, a dog, a pumpkin. What's wrong?
RORY: Oh, nothing.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: Oh, no, it just says that your father is supposed to present you at the ceremony.
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: Whatever, it's no big deal. I can get someone else to do it. Grandpa probably.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: Or Taylor.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: Or the cable guy looked pretty friendly last week. Maybe he has a tux.
LORELAI: Hand me the phone.
RORY: I was kidding about the cable guy. What are you doing?
LORELAI: [dials phone] Look missy, there are plenty of things that should weird you out about coming out, but inviting your father shouldn't be one of them.
OPERATOR: The number you have dialed. . .
LORELAI: Umm, wra. . . gum wrapper.
RORY: He's not going to come.
LORELAI: You don't know until you ask.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: [dials new number] Look, we call, we ask, there's no harm. Trust me. Cable guy's not going anywhere.
CHRISTOPHER: Hello?
LORELAI: Ugh, hi. Where the hell are you?
CHRISTOPER: Boston.
LORELAI: Boston? [walks into living room]
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, Boston. Baked Beans, cream pie, tea party, strangler.
LORELAI: Oh, that Boston.
CHRISTOPHER: And you?
LORELAI: Me.
CHRISTOPHER: Where are you?
LORELAI: Helsinki.
CHRISTOPHER: Really.
LORELAI: Yeah, I finally got the girl band together and after a week opening stateside, we headed across the Atlantic and now we're huge with the Nordic set.
CHRISTOPHER: It's good to hear from you. We haven't talked in awhile.
LORELAI: You could've called too, you know. Or do you have one of those special phones that only receives calls?
CHRISTOPHER: Well, I figured you had a lot going on what with the engagement and the canceling of the engagement. How's that going, by the way?
LORELAI: No, still canceled.
CHRISTOPHER: You okay?
LORELAI: Good. And I'm even better when I'm not talking about it.
CHRISTOPHER: Moving on then.
LORELAI: So I have some shocking news. Rory's coming out.
CHRISTOPHER: Out of what?
LORELAI: Coming out. White dresses, gloves, curtsies.
CHRISTOPHER: Stop it.
LORELAI: I swear to God.
CHRISTOPHER: I can't believe you're letting her do it.
LORELAI: Oh, well, I wasn't about to let her use my method of getting out of it.
CHRISTOPHER: This is crazy.
LORELAI: She's doing it as a favor to my mom, there's no talking her out of it.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, did you tell her about Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke, Gloria Vanderbilt?
LORELAI: Yes, and she's perfectly willing to marry Cary Grant, get offed by her crazy butler and start designing blue jeans as soon as the ball ends.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, okay, if that's what she wants.
LORELAI: Now comes the reason for my phone call.
CHRISTOPHER: All your regular 976 numbers are busy.
LORELAI: Now I know this is totally not your thing, but as you will remember, part of the whole coming out process involves the girls being escorted around the dance floor by their Dads.
CHRISTOPHER: Ah.
LORELAI: Now, I know you would rather sit through "Endless Love" than ever be apart of this scene again. But this is very important to your daughter and she has never asked you for anything, and although no one's keeping track, it would seem that your constant non-presence in her life and your lack of ever showing up when you say you're going to or calling when you say you're going to or basically doing anything when you say you're going to would tend to indicate that you owe her, big time. Now before you say no, I want you to take a minute and remember you have a great daughter who needs you and she has a mother who will hunt you down like a half-priced Kate Spade purse if you disappoint her.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I'm there.
LORELAI: By there, do you mean the Daughters of the American Revolution Annual Debutante Ball?
CHRISTOPHER: Yes.
LORELAI: Oh Chris, please don't make this promise if you can't.
CHRISTOPHER: I wouldn't miss it.
LORELAI: It's next weekend.
CHRISTOPHER: I'll clear my schedule.
LORELAI: You swear?
CHRISTOPHER: Oh wait, next weekend?
LORELAI: Christopher!
CHRISTOPHER: I'm kidding, I will definitely be there.
LORELAI: Okay, and in exchange for that I will refrain from saying the ten things that came to mind for making fun of your schedule.
CHRISTOPHER: Thanks.
LORELAI: Bye.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye.
[Rory walks into living room]
LORELAI: Hey Little Debbie, your dad is definitely gonna be there.
RORY: You're kidding!
LORELAI: No, he's gonna walk you down the stairs, and turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy, and announce that Rory Gilmore is officially open for business.
RORY: I can't believe it. And he definitely said definitely?
LORELAI: Definitely.
RORY: So there's a fifty/fifty chance.
LORELAI: I don't know. He sounded pretty sure, I'd say sixty/forty.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Dean, Lane and Rory are on the couch watching TV while Lorelai walks around the living room talking on the telephone.]
LORELAI: No Mom, I'm sure one crinolin will be plenty. No, she doesn't. I'm sure she doesn't. Yeah, in what scenario would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves, Mom? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant what scenario on my planet would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves?
RORY: So?
DEAN: So what?
RORY: It's good huh?
DEAN: It's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.
RORY: And doesn't Neil Young look cool?
DEAN: I guess.
RORY: If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux.
DEAN: Neil Young looks cool because he's Neil Young, not because he's wearing a tux.
LORELAI: No, I don't have to ask her mom 'cause I know the answer. I know the answer Mom, I know the answer. Yeah, no, okay, well I don't have to ask her MomHold on. Rory, would you like Grandma's hairstylist to come and set your hair before the ball? . . Oh, I did not coach her Mom, go back to talking about gloves.
RORY: I think you're gonna look great in a tux.
LANE: Tails.
DEAN: What?
LANE: Yeah, according to this it says that all escorts must be properly attired in black tails, white cumberbuns, and white gloves.
DEAN: What?
RORY: I'm sure the gloves are optional.
LANE: Not according to this.
DEAN: Tails? Gloves?
RORY: Remember Neil Young. Remember that you love me. Remember that I'll be watching BattleBots with you for a month.
DEAN: Show me Neil Young again.
[Horn honks from outside]
RORY: Dad!
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Christopher is getting out of his car as Rory and Lorelai walk out the front door.]
RORY: Dad! [runs to the car]
CHRISTOPHER: Whoa! Hold it right there. A lady never runs out to meet a gentleman caller who hasn't been announced.
RORY: Sorry, we haven't tamed my wild ways yet.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank God I'm here now.
RORY: I missed you! [hugs him]
CHRISTOPHER: Me too.
LORELAI: Hey.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey.
LORELAI: What is this?
CHRISTOPHER: What? Oh my God, where did this come from?
LORELAI: What happened to your bike?
CHRISTOPHER: A crazy game of key exchange at the car wash.
LORELAI: This is a car.
CHRISTOPHER: Yes it is.
LORELAI: It has four wheels and a roof and airbags and seat belts and my God, it smells like a forest.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, I needed a little more space. Had something big to haul. I believe this belongs to you. [hands Rory a box from the trunk]
RORY: The Compact Oxford English Dictionary!
CHRISTOPHER: I promised you I'd get it. I'm just sorry it took so long.
RORY: That's okay.
CHRISTOPHER: On the bright side, this is the new edition. If I'd gotten you the old one, you wouldn't have the word 'jiggy' in it.
RORY: Thank you. I love it, I'm gonna go look things up right now.
CHRISTOPHER: Wait wait. [hands her magnifying glass]
RORY: Thanks.
CHRISTOPHER: Go. [Rory goes inside]
LORELAI: That was really great of you.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. So back to mocking my car?
LORELAI: Oh yeah. A Volvo sedan, are you kidding?
CHRISTOPHER: This is a great car.
LORELAI: For driving to bingo.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, it just seemed like time. I couldn't keep showing up for work on my bike.
LORELAI: Work?
CHRISTOPHER: You've heard of it.
LORELAI: Yes, but I didn't think you had.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, it took awhile. I kept getting it mixed up with nap, but I finally figured it out.
LORELAI: So, you bought a car and got a job?
CHRISTOPHER: Actually, job then car.
LORELAI: Oh, 'cause it's more responsible that way.
CHRISTOPHER: Exactly.
LORELAI: Wow, so tell me about the job.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, I show up everyday, drink bad coffee, exchange lame pleasantries in the break room with Linda from marketing, and then at the end of two weeks they give me a paycheck. It's a pretty cool system.
LORELAI: You're serious?
CHRISTOPHER: Well, you know how us working types are. Get in.
LORELAI: Well uh. . .I'm not supposed to take rides with strangers.
CHRISTOPHER: Trust me.
LORELAI: Yes, but only if you promise we won't go over 25 miles an hour on the motorway. [Lorelai gets in as Christopher blasts some music] Oh my God, George Lucas wishes he had this sound system.
CHRISTOPHER: I've got Alpine head units, two subs, and two twelves. In exchange, no passenger-side airbag.
LORELAI: Ah, so the old Christopher still lives.
[Rory leans in the car window.]
RORY: Could you please attenuate the cacophony out here?
LORELAI: Huh?
[Rory reaches in and adjusts the volume]
RORY: Turn down the music. [goes back inside]
LORELAI: Next time instead of a dictionary, just slip her a crisp twenty.
CHRISTOPHER: Deal.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai and Emily walk through the front door carrying several shopping bags.]
LORELAI: Twelve pairs of pantyhose.
EMILY: It's going to be a long night. She's bound to have a run.
LORELAI: Twelve pairs.
EMILY: There's the presentation, the circle, the curtsy, the fan dance.
LORELAI: Mom, there'd have to be a 12k run and a jujitsu demonstration for her to go through twelve pairs of pantyhose.
EMILY: Does it really hurt to be prepared, Lorelai?
LORELAI: No, Mom, it doesn't hurt to be prepared.
EMILY: Thank you.
LORELAI: And the good news is, now she is prepared for her high school graduation, her college graduation, her marriage, three to five anniversaries, a hostess gig, and jury duty, especially if she's sequestered.
EMILY: You make me tired.
[Richard walks down the stairs.]
EMILY: Oh Richard, I didn't know you were home.
RICHARD: Yes, well, we learn something everyday.
EMILY: You didn't have to work?
RICHARD: I am working.
LORELAI: Hey Dad, guess how many pairs of pantyhose we bought today?
RICHARD: I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
EMILY: Oh Richard, I got you some beautiful new cufflinks for this weekend.
RICHARD: I already have cufflinks.
EMILY: I know, but these have bulldogs on them. Come look.
RICHARD: I'll look at them later.
EMILY: All right, fine. Just remember to pick up your tux from the cleaners tomorrow.
RICHARD: I won't have time.
EMILY: It's right around the corner from your office.
RICHARD: I have to go in early tomorrow.
EMILY: Well, go now.
RICHARD: I am busy now.
EMILY: Doing what?
RICHARD: Emily, I am not going to qualify my time with you. I am not going to pick up my tuxedo. You planned this ridiculous affair, you pick up my tuxedo. Or I simply don't have to go. Either one of these options is fine with me. [leaves]
LORELAI: Hey Mom, I might be reading too much into this, but um, is something going on between you and Dad?
EMILY: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: I don't know, he just seems a little less jolly than usual.
EMILY: He's just busy.
LORELAI: He seems upset.
EMILY: Well, he's not.
LORELAI: You seem upset.
EMILY: Well I'm not. We're both fine.
LORELAI: Okay, my mistake.
EMILY: I better go pick up his tux.
CUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO
[Rory and Dean are practicing dancing.]
MISS PATTY: Now, keep counting in your heads. Look each other in the eye. Dean, are you leading?
DEAN: I have no idea.
MISS PATTY: Okay okay, stop stop stop. Now remember, one of the most important things in ballroom dancing is to remember to spot, otherwise you're gonna get dizzy. So, what you wanna do is you wanna pick out something to focus on. I usually like to find a lonely seaman. Then when turning, whip your head around and find your spot again. [spins around] Hello sailor, hello sailor, hello sailor. Now you try it.
DEAN: You've gotta be kidding me.
RORY: I think you can do it without the 'hello sailor' part.
DEAN: Rory.
RORY: BattleBots.
DEAN: For the rest of your life.
MISS PATTY: Now take it from the top.
[Rory and Dean start dancing again as Lorelai and Christopher walk in with coffee.]
LORELAI: Hey, you guys are really improving. Now you're actually facing each other.
CHRISTOPHER: Anyone need a break?
MISS PATTY: Okay, take five, but don't sit down because your muscles will get cold.
LORELAI: So how's it going?
RORY: Actually, I'm not very good.
DEAN: Yeah, which is really holding me back because I'm a natural.
LORELAI: Well, maybe you just need a glittery glove and a really freaky face.
RORY: At one point Miss Patty thought Dean was gonna get hurt, she made me sit in the corner and watch.
LORELAI: Hey! Nobody puts Baby in the corner.
CHRISTOPHER: It's not your fault. Ballroom dancing is a wonderfully sexist thing. Any woman can do it, all she needs is a strong male lead. No offense Dean. [He pulls Lorelai towards him, but she stumbles.]
LORELAI: Oh, agh!
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, well, most any woman can do it.
LORELAI: I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready. I want a do over.
CHRISTOPHER: Fine. May I have this dance?
LORELAI: I don't know. Do you have a trust fund? Always make sure.
[Lorelai and Christopher start dancing. When they're done, Rory and Dean clap.]
RORY: Okay, I'm adopted.
DEAN: Yeah, I'm never gonna be able to do that.
CHRISTOPHER: No, you guys just need some practice.
MISS PATTY: Listen to your father, Rory. Your adorable, adorable father.
LORELAI: Come on, let's get you out of here before you become Patty's next husband.
CHRISTOPHER: See you guys later. Bye Patty.
MISS PATTY: Oh, the way you toy with me.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai and Christopher walk out of the dance studio each holding a coffee cup.]
LORELAI: Did you know you still knew how to do that?
CHRISTOPHER: I wish I didn't. Imagine what we could do if we freed up the brain space that holds onto the Vianese Waltz.
LORELAI: Yeah, it's right up there in between old Brady Bunch reruns and the lyrics to Rapture.
CHRISTOPHER: Ooh, I gotta say, this isn't like the chai lattes in Boston.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, expecting Luke to make a chai anything was completely insane.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he just threw a cinnamon stick in some tea.
LORELAI: I'm pretty sure it's not a cinnamon stick.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, throwing this out now.
LORELAI: So chai latte, when did that happen?
CHRISTOPHER: I don't know. Everyone at work drinks them.
LORELAI: Huh. Well, since you still haven't told me what exactly it is that you do, I'm gonna go with yoga instructor or chiropractor.
CHRISTOPHER: No, it's actually pretty interesting. I'm working for this firm that helps those overblown tech companies scale back and stay afloat now that they're facing leaner times.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, uh, what's the interesting part?
CHRISTOPHER: We dress like superheroes when we do it.
LORELAI: Oh, nice. So how long do you think you'll be able to keep this going?
CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm pretty happy there. I'd say at least 'til Tuesday.
LORELAI: Oh, so long term.
CHRISTOPHER: You know, it's weird. I always hated the idea of having to be somewhere at a specific time day after day, but as it turns out, I like the stability.
LORELAI: Really?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. I like that at the end of the day, I feel like I've done something. I've earned something.
LORELAI: Well, I think that's really great.
CHRISTOPHER: Only took me ten years and several failed business ventures to figure out what I wanted.
LORELAI: Which is?
CHRISTOPHER: Not my parents' life.
LORELAI: Ah.
CHRISTOPHER: Something you figured out at sixteen.
LORELAI: Actually, six months, but I just couldn't vocalize it yet.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, you knew what you wanted, you went out and got it. I was always a little jealous of you.
LORELAI: Well, you seem to be catching up. We did good.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Well, I did good. The fact that she can't follow a lead is all you.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory sits on the couch painting her toenails, Christopher helps Dean tie his bowtie, Lorelai walks around with a book on her head eating Chinese food.]
LORELAI: See now, only a lady can gracefully walk around a room with a book on her head while eating Kung Pao chicken. And a great lady can even spit the peanuts back into the container without anyone noticing.
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, don't be intimidated. You have to practice and practice to get to my level.
RORY: Anyone want the last eggroll?
DEAN: Uh, no.
LORELAI: Heh. Where are you going?
RORY: To get the eggroll.
LORELAI: You're getting the eggroll yourself?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: No! Ladies never get their own eggrolls. Ladies never get their own anything. They don't even get their own ideas.
RORY: Oh boy.
LORELAI: They just sit helplessly and wait for some young strong man to come by and assist them. They don't step in puddles, they don't step over puddles. They can't even look at puddles. They actually need to be blindfolded and thrown in a sack and carried over puddles.
RORY: Isn't there a moratorium on how long ladies are supposed to talk?
LORELAI: Uhh, no. Now repeat after me, I am completely helpless.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so you pull the left side through the back loop and tug a little bit on both sides, and you my friend, might just be mistaken for a gentleman. Or a waiter.
DEAN: So, how do you know how to do this?
CHRISTOPHER: Seventeen cotillions, a dozen debutante balls, and a brief but scarring experiment with the Children of the American Revolution.
LORELAI: Where you wore nothing but the bowtie.
CHRISTOPHER: A good idea on conception, but the sudden snowstorm instantly dampened the effect.
DEAN: Hey, uh, do you think it's cool when Neil Young wears a tux?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, of course, but it's Neil Young.
DEAN: All right. I should get going. I'll see you at three.
RORY: Okay. Oh wait. [hands him a box]
DEAN: What's this?
RORY: Your gloves.
DEAN: I thought you were kidding.
LORELAI: No no. Ladies never kid.
DEAN: Bye. [leaves]
LORELAI: Bye.
RORY: I think I'm going to bed too.
LORELAI: Do you need help?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Wrong! The correct answer is yes. Ladies need help with everything.
RORY: Goodnight.
LORELAI: [sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: Night.
RORY: Night.
LORELAI: I don't know about that girl. I don't know how she's ever gonna make it in society. At this rate, she's gonna actually get a job and only marry once.
CHRISTOPHER: You calling your mom again?
LORELAI: I don't get it. For the last week, every five minutes she's calling me checking on shoe fittings and curtsy progress, and have I talked Rory into putting her hair up yet, and then tonight, nothing.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm sure they had a lot of getting ready to do for themselves tonight.
LORELAI: She's been acting so weird lately. They're fighting. Openly fighting. I don't think they've ever done that before. I'm not sure what to do about it.
CHRISTOPHER: Move to California. That's what I do when my parents fight.
LORELAI: You know, my father doesn't even want to go tomorrow. His perfect angle granddaughter is being presented to society in front of all his friends and colleagues, something he never got to do with his bad, loser, evil daughter.
CHRISTOPHER: Maybe you should talk to them. I'm sorry, was that me that said that? I must've had an aneurysm.
LORELAI: Well, nothing more I can do tonight. I'm gonna head up to bed. Do you want me to turn off the lights?
CHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to stay up and do a little work tonight.
[Lorelai laughs]
LORELAI: I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that's not a joke anymore.
CHRISTOPHER: Goodnight.
CUT TO BALLROOM
[Lorelai and Rory arrive at the ballroom.]
RORY: Wow, this place is huge. Do I have to walk down those stairs?
LORELAI: Oh, I'm afraid so. Unless you wanna make a really memorable entrance and just sliiide down the banister. Which I totally encourage, by the way.
LADY: You are
RORY: Lorelai Gilmore.
LADY: Late.
LORELAI: Sorry, my fault. Took me awhile to get pretty. Not all of us are sixteen anymore, you know what I mean? No.
LADY: You are to head up the stairs. The preparation room is on the right.
LORELAI: Look for the toxic cloud of Chanel and Final Net.
[Rory starts walking towards the stairs. She looks back at Lorelai.]
LORELAI: [mouths] Sliiide.
CUT TO PREPARATION ROOM
[Rory and the lady enter the room. Other girls are walking around getting dressed and doing their makeup.]
LADY: Hang your dress there, put your makeup on over there. You'll have to make do with a non-lighted mirror. The lighted ones went to the girls that were here before dawn. Listen up ladies, everyone must be beautiful and ready to go by 7:30.
[Rory sits down at a mirror. She talks to the girl next to her.]
RORY: I can't believe we have an hour and a half.
LIBBY: I know, I am never gonna be ready in time. God only knows if the swelling on my nose is gonna go down. I had to go and inherit my father's nose. I'm Libby.
RORY: Rory.
LIBBY: Uh, which one should I wear? I've thought about this all month, and I cannot decide.
RORY: Oh, well, that's a tough one.
LIBBY: I know. This is red red, and this is orange red. The wrong one and I will end up looking like a hooker. Or a teacher.
RORY: That's a lot of pressure.
LIBBY: The two minutes you are standing on those stairs tonight will determine the social status for the rest of your life.
RORY: Wow, what if you trip? I mean, not that you would. You wouldn't. I might. Probably will actually. Could be a real Cirque du Soleil kind of night.
LIBBY: You should not even joke about stuff like that. Ow. There's a head under there, you know.
CUT TO BALLROOM
[The bartender hands Lorelai a drink.]
LORELAI: You are a wonderful, wonderful man. I have a feeling we're going to be very close tonight. [sees Emily] Hmm. Mom, you're here.
EMILY: Where should I be, Spain?
LORELAI: Oh. I tried calling you all night last night.
EMILY: I was very busy.
LORELAI: And then we got here before you.
EMILY: What is your point, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Nothing. It's just weird.
EMILY: Well, I'm here now, so it's not weird anymore. Look at these flowers. Baby's breath. What is this, County General?
LORELAI: You look very nice Mom. I like your dress.
EMILY: Cotton tablecloths, folding chairs. It's not supposed to be like this. In my day, people sat in real chairs.
LORELAI: Mom, what's the matter?
EMILY: I wanted my granddaughter to be presented to society in a beautiful elegant ballroom, not a Shakey's.
LORELAI: The room is beautiful Mom. You're being too critical.
EMILY: There's Nan. I'm going to have a little talk with her about the proper height for a taper.
LORELAI: Mom.
CUT TO PREPARATION ROOM
[Rory is sitting down reading when Libby walks over to her holding a flask.]
LIBBY: Midori sour?
RORY: Oh, no thanks.
LIBBY: More for me. At my last coming out, I shared with this girl who couldn't handle her booze. Neon green puke all over her white dress.
RORY: Your last coming out?
LIBBY: Oh, this is my fifth one this year.
RORY: Wow.
LIBBY: You know, they say four out of five debs marry their escorts.
RORY: Kind of like the dentists with Trident.
LIBBY: Well I figure, five coming out balls, five escorts, one of them has to stick, right?
RORY: Good logic.
LIBBY: So, is your escort the one?
RORY: The one what?
LIBBY: The one you're gonna marry.
RORY: Oh, well
LIBBY: Is he cute?
RORY: Yes, he is very cute but
LIBBY: Where are you guys planning to live when you get married?
RORY: Okay, hold on a second.
[Another girl walks over]
LIBBY: Katie, hi. Too bad about your face.
KATIE: Is it horrible?
LIBBY: No, you can hardly tell. Just walk sideways.
CUT TO BALLROOM
[Lorelai is standing with some women.]
LADY 1: These things will be the death of me.
LADY 2: Oh I know. And we've had no time to prep. Janet just got out of Rainbow Hills two days ago.
LORELAI: Rehab?
LADY 1: Fat farm.
LORELAI: Ah.
[Christopher walks up to Lorelai]
CHRISTOPHER: Hi, sorry to interrupt. Could you come with me? My cumberbun and I aren't seeing eye to eye.
LORELAI: Men, totally helpless. Excuse me.
[They walk away from the women]
LORELAI: You saved me. I love you. I wanna have your baby. Oops, too late.
CHRISTOPHER: I saw the look. Same one you had that time you ended up on homecoming court.
LORELAI: Ugh, someone's idea of a sick, sick joke. Hey, by the way, Neil Young's got nothing on you.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah.
[Emily walks over to them]
EMILY: Lorelai, have you seen your father?
LORELAI: Uh, no.
EMILY: He promised me he'd be here by now.
LORELAI: Wait, you didn't come together?
EMILY: I swear, if he misses this
LORELAI: Well, Mom, did you call him?
EMILY: Yes I called him. Of course I called him. I wouldn't go this long without calling him.
CHRISTOPHER: Emily, he's here.
EMILY: Where? [he points to him] Oh. [walks to Richard] Richard, where have you been?
RICHARD: Where have I been?
EMILY: Yes, where have you been?
RICHARD: I'm here, aren't I?
LORELAI: I can't look. Did she beat him with the baby's breath?
CHRISTOPHER: No, they're just energetically practicing their sign language.
LORELAI: Oh God.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I think this is a really good time for a martini. Hello. Thirsty people here. [Lorelai goes behind the bar] Ah, what are you doing?
LORELAI: Steve won't mind.
CHRISTOPHER: Little tip. Never a good idea to let people know you're on a first name basis with the bartender. Wow, this is really something.
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: You and I together at a debutante ball.
LORELAI: Huh, yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Just like it would've been sixteen years ago.
LORELAI: Fancy dress.
CHRISTOPHER: Sneaking booze.
LORELAI: Parents acting crazy.
CHRISTOPHER: You look great.
LORELAI: I'm so glad you're here.
CHRISTOPHER: So am I.
ANNOUNCER: All fathers please report to the debutante staging area upstairs. Fathers to the staging area.
CHRISTOPHER: Showtime. You gonna be all right?
LORELAI: Absolutely.
CHRISTOPHER: I'll see you later.
LORELAI: Curtsy pretty.
CUT TO STAGING AREA
[Rory's waiting in line. Dean walks up to her.]
DEAN: Hey. I just wanted to see you before you became a proper lady of society.
RORY: So what do you think?
DEAN: I think you look like a cotton ball.
RORY: Why, thank you Jeeves.
DEAN: But a really cute cotton ball.
[Libby walks up to Rory.]
LIBBY: Oh my God, is this your escort?
RORY: Yeah, it is.
LIBBY: You are totally getting married. [walks away]
DEAN: What did she say?
RORY: Oh, well...[sees Christopher] Dad, great, let's go.
DEAN: I'll, uh, I'll meet you downstairs. Good luck. [leaves]
RORY: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: Last chance to shimmy down the drainpipe.
RORY: Do me a favor?
CHRISTOPHER: Anything.
RORY: Just don't let me fall.
CHRISTOPHER: Right back at ya.
CUT TO BALLROOM [The ball begins as a lady addresses the audience from a podium on the staircase. Lorelai sits at a table; Emily and Richard stand near the bar.]
LADY AT PODIUM: Good evening. On behalf of the Daughters of the American Revolution, I would like to welcome you to our annual debutante ball. Oh this brings back so many memories. I myself came out in this very hall in nineteenwell, let's just say, a number of years ago. Now the word debutante comes from the French word debuter, which means to lead off. . .[fades into background]
EMILY: Just come sit down.
RICHARD: I am going to finish my drink.
EMILY: You won't be happy until you've spoiled this entire evening, will you?
LORELAI: Um, guys, hi, there's a lady up there with a rock the size of Neptune around her neck talking about the debutantes of ancient Greece. It's a lot easier to fall asleep if you're sitting down, trust me.
RICHARD: I will sit down when I'm ready to sit down.
EMILY: Richard, lower your voice.
RICHARD: No, I will not lower my voice. I paid a fortune to be here, and I will speak just as loudly as I like.
EMILY: You're embarrassing us. You're embarrassing Rory.
RICHARD: Embarrassing Rory? This wasn't Rory's idea. This was your idea. This whole ridiculous evening was your idea, Emily.
EMILY: You don't want your granddaughter presented to society?
RICHARD: To hell with society. [people look at him] Yes, I'm talking about you!
LORELAI: Come on, that's it.
[Lorelai leads them into another room]
LORELAI: Are you two completely out of your mind? There is a ceremony going on in there. Young girls in ugly dresses and stupid fans are parading around in circles for God knows what reason, and you two are ruining it.
RICHARD: I didn't want to come here. You knew I didn't want to come here.
EMILY: Well, that's too bad. We have a social responsibility Richard.
RICHARD: I am so tired of hearing you say that.
EMILY: People expect us to be certain places and do certain things and we can't just withdraw from all of that.
RICHARD: Do you know what I'm going through at work?
EMILY: Your whole life isn't that damn company, Richard.
RICHARD: I have told you what I'm going through, but somehow, you just don't seem to hear it. You don't listen to me. You don't listen to anybody.
EMILY: That is not true.
RICHARD: It is true. Isn't it true? Has she ever listened to a word you've said?
LORELAI: Oh, well, hey, people listen in different ways, right? I mean, some people listen with their ears, and some people listen with not their ears, but that doesn't mean some actual listening hasn't happened in some form.
EMILY: I have listened to you Richard. I know exactly what is going on with you.
RICHARD: Really, what?
EMILY: You lost an account.
LORELAI: What?
RICHARD: No, I didn't lose an account. I was taken off an account. I was taken off an account that I personally brought into this company ten years ago.
EMILY: There are other accounts, Richard.
RICHARD: I have been in charge of that account for ten years!
EMILY: How can you be so angry? Yes, they took you off that account, but they also gave you a promotion.
RICHARD: Oh, Emily.
EMILY: You said they moved you upstairs to a larger office and gave you a new title and a better parking space.
RICHARD: Emily, dammit, I am being phased out.
EMILY: You are not.
RICHARD: What do you mean I'm not? I know whether I'm being phased out. I invented phased out for this company. Don't you think I did the exact same thing to Alan Parker?
EMILY: Alan Parker retired.
RICHARD: Alan Parker was phased out. I now have his office, I now have his parking space. Do you know what happens from here? I lose more accounts, slowly but surely. They will put a younger man on them with me to be trained by the best. And then, one day they'll call and ask me to let that young man take a meeting without me, just to see how fast he's learning, and then suddenly that young man is given that account. And this happens again and again and again until I'm nothing, but a symbolic figurehead that they roll out for banquets and group pictures. And then one day, Emily, I will be asked to leave.
EMILY: Well, so what?
RICHARD: Excuse me.
LORELAI: Dad, I don't think Mom meant exactly
EMILY: So what if that's true?
LORELAI: Or maybe she did.
EMILY: There are other options.
RICHARD: I don't want other options. I want to get up every morning and put on my suit, and go to my office, and do my work, like I've done everyday for the past thirty years. That's what I want to do. That's the only thing I want to do.
[Rory leans into the hallway.]
RORY: Um, excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt, but I'm next.
[They walk back into the ballroom]
LADY AT PODIUM: Elizabeth Dotie, daughter of George Edward Dotie the fourth, and Elenor Dotie. [pause] Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Christopher Hayden and Lorelai Gilmore.
[Christopher and Rory walk down the stairs as Dean waits at the bottom. Christopher kisses Rory's hand, Rory curtsies, Christopher walks away, Dean walks Rory down the aisle.]
EMILY: That should've been you up there. Nothing's turning out the way it was supposed to. [walks away]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
[Later that night, Lorelai, Christopher, Rory, and Dean walk down the sidewalk.]
RORY: So did you know that you're considered a hot Dad?
LORELAI: Hah!
CHRISTOPHER: Really?
RORY: Libby said that it's too bad you're my real Dad because if you were my stepdad, I could steal you away from mom.
LORELAI: Ugh.
CHRISTOPHER: That Libby's got a good life ahead of her.
LORELAI: Well, I was very proud of all of you. You made it through the entire ceremony with a completely straight face. Almost all of you.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry, but that fan dance was more than I could take.
LORELAI: Hey, I need a burger.
RORY: Me too. Dean?
DEAN: Honestly, the only thing I can think of is taking off this tux.
LORELAI: Hey, watch it, you're talking to a lady now.
DEAN: Well, how about if I do it at home?
LORELAI: Better.
RORY: Thanks again for going with me.
DEAN: Tomorrow you start paying. Bye. [leaves]
LORELAI: Bye. And then there were three.
CHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to get back to Boston first thing in the morning so I'm gonna call it a night too.
RORY: What? Not even time for fries?
CHRISTOPHER: I'll tell you what. I'll get up a little early and have coffee with you before I go. Deal?
RORY: Deal.
LORELAI: Honey, go ahead and order for us. I'll be there in a sec.
RORY: Okay. [leaves]
LORELAI: I just wanted to tell you how amazing you were tonight. Really, you completely came through for her.
CHRISTOPHER: She deserves it.
LORELAI: I haven't always given you a lot of credit in the past, but I'm giving you credit now. Big credit. Major credit. Buy yourself a sofa.
CHRISTOPHER: Thanks. I will.
LORELAI: You know, um, I happened to be looking through some old maps this afternoon and I couldn't help but notice that Boston is not that far away.
CHRISTOPHER: Aw, you needed a map to tell you that?
LORELAI: I also noticed that that, um, I-84 is a very good road. Solid, paved.
CHRISTOPHER: Uh huh.
LORELAI: And I put this information in my pretty little head, I was thinking, if you wanted to maybe drop by occasionally, it wouldn't be too difficult.
CHRISTOPHER: You realize I'll be driving the Volvo?
LORELAI: Actually, I'm coming around to the Vovlo.
CHRISTOPHER: Really?
LORELAI: Yes. I think it's sort of a Catholic schoolgirl thing, you know? It's conservative on the outside, bad on the inside.
CHRISTOPHER: I like that image.
LORELAI: I've also heard the I-84 can get jammed on the weekends.
CHRISTOPHER: It can.
LORELAI: So if you wanted to stay a little longer, just to avoid the traffic, it might be a good idea. I mean, Rory would definitely love it, and I wouldn't mind either. CHRISTOPHER: That is a tempting offer, but I really have to get back.
LORELAI: To work?
CHRISTOPHER: To workand to someone.
LORELAI: Oh.
CHRISTOPHER: I know I should've told you.
LORELAI: Oh no, that's fine. That's totally your business.
CHRISTOPHER: No, I meant to, butLor, it's just that you and I are so connected and...
LORELAI: Chris, please, I get it. I think it's really great, I really do.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.
LORELAI: So who is it? Ooh, let me guess. Linda from marketing got to you, didn't she?
CHRISTOPHER: Her name is Sherri.
LORELAI: Sherri from marketing?
CHRISTOPHER: Sherri from Boston.
LORELAI: Ah, hence the move.
CHRISTOPHER: Yes.
LORELAI: Is it serious?
CHRISTOPHER: It's getting there.
LORELAI: Seeing you in just a bowtie serious?
CHRISTOPHER: We're living together.
LORELAI: Wow, you really have changed.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well, Sherri made it pretty clear that I was gonna lose her if I didn't start getting it together, so...
LORELAI: Yeah, well if you find a girl who's good with dating a square in a Volvo, you do what it takes to keep her.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, uh, so I'll. . .I'll see you back home.
LORELAI: Yes you will.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Rory is about to bite into her burger as Lorelai walks in.]
LORELAI: [gasps] Hey!
RORY: What?
LORELAI: After all you've been through tonight and I come in here and find you eating like that.
[Rory raises her pinkie]
LORELAI: There you go.
RORY: Being a lady is hard.
LORELAI: So tonight, what's the consensus?
RORY: The fan dance was humiliating, I'm never doing a curtsy again, but having Dad around was great.
LORELAI: Yeah, it was.
RORY: He's got a new girlfriend, you know.
LORELAI: Sherri.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Poor girl's named after a Journey song, that's gotta be rough.
RORY: He seems happy.
LORELAI: He does. He really does.
RORY: I'm glad.
LORELAI: Me too.
RORY: I feel kind of bad for Grandma though. She was so into this night and then she ended up being so miserable.
LORELAI: Don't worry. She'll have more fun at the next one.
RORY: Excuse me?
LORELAI: Yes, we have you signed up for the next six balls.
RORY: Not funny.
LORELAI: Hey, you're doing this until you bring home a prize.
RORY: Ignoring you now.
[Luke brings Lorelai her burger.]
LUKE: So, back from the ball huh?
LORELAI: Yes, I left behind a glass slipper and a business card in case the prince is really dumb.
LUKE: Good and desperate thinking.
LORELAI: Thank you. Hmm, Luke.
LUKE: What?
[Lorelai nods towards Jess, who is wiping down the counter dressed like Luke, complete with flannel shirt and backwards baseball cap. Luke walks over to him.]
LUKE: What do you think you're doing?
JESS: Working.
LUKE: So you think this is funny, huh?
JESS: I'm sorry. I thought this was the uniform.
LUKE: Okay, you know what, that's fine. Have your little joke, you know. It doesn't bother me at all. You just go over there and clean off that table, okay? I'm ignoring you. You do not exist.
JESS: Okay.
LUKE: That's it, get upstairs and change.
JESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke.
LUKE: It's Luke, just Luke. Mister Luke. In fact, don't address me at all.
LORELAI: You know, I'm really lucky.
RORY: Yeah, why?
LORELAI: I have someone to complain to when life sucks or work sucks or just everything sucks. I have someone I can talk to.
RORY: Yeah, who?
LORELAI: Oh Shecky, you k*ll me. It just must be really lonely not to have that.
RORY: Are you thinking about Grandma?
LORELAI: I'm just. . .thinking.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Emily is gardening on the back patio as Lorelai walks out the back door.]
LORELAI: Hey Mom.
EMILY: What are you doing here?
LORELAI: Oh, nothing much. I had a little time before my business class and I thought, 'Hey, why don't I just go over to Mom's house and just hang.'
EMILY: Just what?
LORELAI: Just hang, you know. Hang out. Talk, don't talk, whatever. Just hang.
EMILY: Oh.
LORELAI: So you're gardening, huh?
EMILY: Yes.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, don't let me stop you. I'll just sit here and just hang.
EMILY: Are you sure you don't need something?
LORELAI: Nope. I'm just here to hang.
EMILY: Hang. Well.
LORELAI: You know Mom, if there's ever anything you want to talk about with me, you can.
EMILY: All right.
LORELAI: Okay. So

OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner.]
EMILY: How's the meal?
RORY: Tasty.
LORELAI: Very tasty. New cook?
EMILY: Yes, Marisella. She's introduced us to some wonderful dishes so charmingly specific to her native country.
LORELAI: What country is she from?
EMILY: One of those little ones next to Mexico.
LORELAI: How charmingly specific.
RORY: Too bad Grandpa's not here. He likes weird food.
LORELAI: Yeah, where's he eating his weird food tonight? Argentina? Morocco?
EMILY: Akron.
RORY: Ohio?
EMILY: Yes.
LORELAI: Get out of here.
EMILY: I will not get out of here.
LORELAI: No Mom, I didn't mean really get out of here, I mean
RORY: Why is Grandpa in Akron?
EMILY: I don't know.
LORELAI: It was just a saying.
EMILY: They sent him to deal with some problem with their local office down there.
LORELAI: A saying, you know, like 'save me' or 'get me out of here'. Things like that.
EMILY: Lorelai, would you like me to put a mirror in front of you so you can look at yourself while you have this conversation?
LORELAI: Sorry, Dad's in Akron.
EMILY: Yes. The amenities are atrociously lacking. He had to eat at a coffee shop last night. The whole thing's terribly insulting. He's miserable.
RORY: I hate that he's miserable.
EMILY: So do I. We really ought to do something.
RORY: Yes, I agree.
LORELAI: Warning, warning.
EMILY: I'm glad to hear you say that Rory, because I thought of a wonderful way to cheer him up.
RORY: Cool, what?
LORELAI: Danger, Will Robinson, danger!
EMILY: An oil portrait of you for his study.
RORY: An oil portrait.
LORELAI: I tried, have fun.
EMILY: It could hang right over his mantle. He'd just love it.
RORY: Well, I guess that would be okay.
LORELAI: Oh Mom, please, don't make her do this.
EMILY: She just said she would.
LORELAI: Fine, paint the picture, but don't make her sit and pose for it. Paint it from a photo.
EMILY: A photo? That's what they do at malls.
RORY: I'll sit, it's fine.
EMILY: Just because your own experience sitting for a portrait was bad doesn't mean Rory's has to be.
RORY: What portrait? I haven't seen this.
LORELAI: They never finished.
EMILY: Three painters started, and they all three quit.
RORY: Why did they quit?
EMILY: She wouldn't stop scowling.
LORELAI: I was going for a Billy Idol thing.
EMILY: The one from Italy had some sort of breakdown.
RORY: Oh my God.
LORELAI: Hey, it didn't hurt Van Gogh, the guy should thank me.
EMILY: A year later, I swear I saw him rummaging through our recyclables.
RORY: Well, I'm happy to sit. If it's for Grandpa, why not?
EMILY: Wonderful. I'll set it up first thing in the morning.
LORELAI: Psst. If you want, I can teach you the Billy Idol. Most people focus on the lip thing, but the eyes are just as import...
[Emily slams the salt shaker on the table. Lorelai stops talking.]
OPENING CREDITS
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Luke are sitting at a table talking.]
LUKE: So, the first thing you and Sookie would do is incorporate.
LORELAI: Wow. Sounds so big time.
LUKE: Not really. It just means you're a single business entity. You'll both be officers and shareholders, and you'll get to make up a name for your company and everything.
LORELAI: Mmm, I'm terrible at coming up with names. When we first bought out house, Rory and I wanted to name it, you know, like Jefferson named his place Monticello, but all we could come up with is The Crap Shack.
LUKE: Nice.
[Jess walks over with a coffeepot]
JESS: Coffee?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, thanks. How are you Jess?
JESS: Well, I'm not bleeding or anything.
LORELAI: Well, then it's gonna be a good day, huh?
JESS: Yeah. It's 7:45.
LUKE: So?
JESS: So do you want me to go to school or do you want to openly defy child labor laws?
LUKE: Go. Stay out of trouble.
JESS: Guess that means calling off the chickie run down at the salt flax.
LUKE: Out. [Jess leaves]
LORELAI: Wow, so much love.
LUKE: So, you guys have a site in mind for the inn?
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: Great, where?
LORELAI: You've seen pictures of it. The Rachel property.
LUKE: Oh, right.
LORELAI: Sorry.
LUKE: It's okay.
LORELAI: I just meant, Rachel took the pictures, and the pictures kind of got us into the place, so we started calling it the Rachel property 'cause it made sense at the time and then it became a habit. But now out of respect for you, I'm gonna stop repeatedly using her name and uh, think of another name to call it. Let's see, The Crap Shack's taken.
LUKE: It's okay. Call it what you want.
LORELAI: So, who taught you about all this business stuff? Your dad?
LUKE: Please. My dad didn't even have a checking account until I finally got taller then he was. He bought this land with cash from working construction, built this place himself. Didn't have a bookkeeper, an accountant, or anything.
LORELAI: Wow, so you had no one showing you the ropes.
LUKE: Nope, I figured I had to just dive in on my own, fail if that's my destiny, and forget what the experts say.
LORELAI: That is exactly my philosophy. Exactly. Except I'm not diving in on my own, I'm diving in with Sookie, and, uh, failure is not even a choice of destinies, and I'm consulting any expert who will listen to me. Otherwise, it's identical.
LUKE: Well, I should be getting going. You gonna write this meal off?
LORELAI: Why?
LUKE: Oh, we talked business. You gotta be thinking about these things.
LORELAI: No, I mean, why? I'm not paying for it. [Luke sighs] Exactly.
LUKE: You're gonna do fine.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Lorelai and Sookie are talking in the kitchen as Michel walks in.]
LORELAI: It shouldn't be too flashy.
SOOKIE: How about something historical, like 'The Paul Revere'?
LORELAI: Oh, that could work.
MICHEL: What could work?
LORELAI: We're thinking up names for the inn we're gonna open.
SOOKIE: I mean, if you want simple, something like 'The Country Rose'.
LORELAI: That's pretty good.
SOOKIE: We could line the front path with multicolored roses.
LORELAI: Or. . or 'The Inn by the Hollow'. Kind of long.
SOOKIE: No, but nice.
MICHEL: How about 'The Money Pit'?
LORELAI: Boo.
MICHEL: Or 'The Outhouse'. Go international.
SOOKIE: Go back in your hole.
MICHEL: Or 'The Inn Heading for Bankruptcy'. Kind of long, but nice.
SOOKIE: You who have no dreams rain on those who do.
MICHEL: I say this because I care about you. It's risky what you are doing. Most new businesses go down within two years.
LORELAI: I say if we go down after two years, it'll be the most exciting two years of our lives.
SOOKIE: Same here. Boredom stinks.
MICHEL: Fine, proceed blindly. [hands Lorelai some papers] Here, it came in ten minutes ago. It does not involve the Independence Inn, therefore delivering it was beyond my official obligations, so I am taking an extra long lunch break. [leaves]
SOOKIE: He's so genuine.
LORELAI: Oh my God.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: It's the title search for the Rachel property. And guess who owns it.
SOOKIE: Tell me it's not that b*st*rd Donald Trump.
LORELAI: Fran.
SOOKIE: Fran from Weston's Bakery?
LORELAI: Sweet little Fran, the cupcake lady. Not some cigar-chomping, dirty dealing city slicker.
SOOKIE: Ooh! That's good. Hey! 'The Country Slicker.' Funny name, cutesy idea
LORELAI: Mm, it's a little much.
SOOKIE: It's way too much.
LORELAI: I'll call Fran.
SOOKIE: 'Fran's Old Place'! It'll be like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. People will be trying to figure out who Fran is. Or 'The In Inn'! It's like an inn that's in with the in crowd. . .I'm gonna go sit down.
LORELAI: Do that sweetie.
SOOKIE: Okay.
CUT TO OUTSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET
[Taylor walks down the sidewalk to his store. Right in front of it, there is a chalk outline of a body on the sidewalk surrounded by police tape.]
CUT TO BAKERY
[Lorelai is sitting at a table as Sookie walks in and sits down with her.]
SOOKIE: Honey, I'm so sorry. Am I late late or just late?
LORELAI: Two pieces of carrot cake and a rumball.
SOOKIE: Ah, I am so sorry! I swear I meant to be on time, but I was prepping the raspberry glaze for tonight's dessert special, and it struck me. I made a blueberry glaze for the soufflé I made last Tuesday, and this is Tuesday, and a lot of locals come every week on the same night every week, and I just didn't want to serve them some. . .like a similar dessert even though it's a completely different berry. . .
LORELAI: I need another rumball.
SOOKIE: Ah, I'm sorry.
LORELAI: No, you're a perfectionist, and that attention to detail is why people call you the Maestro.
SOOKIE: Really? Who calls me that?
LORELAI: The people who eat the rumballs.
[Fran walks over to their table.]
FRAN: So ladies, how are we doing here?
SOOKIE: Oh, we're doing great Fran.
FRAN: Oh, well that's wonderful.
LORELAI: Fran, could Sookie and I talk to you for a couple minutes?
FRAN: Oh, of course. Marjorie can handle things. [sits down] Oooh.
LORELAI: Fran, are you okay?
FRAN: Aw, it's this bum hip. It needs to be replaced, again. And I have this awful angina.
SOOKIE: Oh, we're so sorry to hear that.
FRAN: So, I know you didn't come here to listen to me gripe, so tell me what's on your mind.
LORELAI: Okay, well Fran, we understand that you own the old Dragonfly Bed and Breakfast, that whole property out there.
FRAN: Why, yes I do. It was my parents' business.
SOOKIE: It's a beautiful place.
FRAN: Oh, it used to be. But it's in such disarray now.
LORELAI: Yes it is, and that's kind of why we're here. We'd actually like to buy it.
FRAN: Buy the Dragonfly?
LORELAI: Yes, we'd like to buy it and make it beautiful again, and we're prepared to make you an offer right now.
FRAN: Oh my, well this is a surprise.
LORELAI: See, Sookie and I are gonna start our own inn and we've been searching for the perfect place.
FRAN: Your own inn?
LORELAI: Yeah.
FRAN: Oh how wonderful! You are going to be so successful.
SOOKIE: Thanks Sweetie.
LORELAI: That means so much, like we have your blessing.
FRAN: But I can't sell you the property.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: How come?
FRAN: I just couldn't. You know, I have no siblings and no children and in a ways, that place is really the only family I have. I'm the last Weston left, so I plan to own it forever.
LORELAI: Forever?
FRAN: Forever and ever.
LORELAI: That's a very long time.
SOOKIE: A very long time.
FRAN: I'm so sorry.
LORELAI: Fran, may I ask. . . um. . .
FRAN: Go ahead honey, ask me anything you want.
LORELAI: Well, what happens to the place if you. . .well, if forever isn't quite forever?
FRAN: I don't understand dear. All I know is that I can't sell the place.
LORELAI: Oh no, I don't mean selling it. I mean, you would keep it forever, but what happens once you're no longer in the position of physically controlling the property?
FRAN: How could that be?
LORELAI: Uh, well, if you um, if you
SOOKIE: Take a long vacation.
LORELAI: Yes, take a long vacation. Thank you.
SOOKIE: You're welcome.
LORELAI: And when you're on that long vacation, the property is just left sitting there. Well, what happens then?
FRAN: Oh, I don't enjoy vacations. I toured the California gold country ten years ago, it was hot and the bus smelled.
LORELAI: Okay, I mean a longer vacation than a trip to California.
SOOKIE: To a different place.
FRAN: What kind of place?
LORELAI: A place out there.
SOOKIE: Way out there Fran.
FRAN: Europe?
LORELAI: I mean the ultimate long vacation.
SOOKIE: Yeah, Francie, eventually, we're all gonna take the same long vacation.
LORELAI: And with that being the case, you might want to sell the property now and enjoy the money.
FRAN: I'm very sorry, but I can never sell the place.
LORELAI: Oh, well thanks for your time Fran.
SOOKIE: Yeah, thanks Fran.
FRAN: Bye now.
LORELAI: Bye.
SOOKIE: Bye.
FRAN: You both look so sad. Would you like a cupcake?
LORELAI: Please.
SOOKIE: Yeah.
FRAN: Good.
CUT TO SIDEWALK
[Rory and Lane are walking down the sidewalk in Stars Hollow.]
LANE: So, Janie Fertman's trying to be my friend again.
RORY: Yikes. What kind of vibe are you giving her?
LANE: Oh, my patented Keith Richards circa 1969 'don't mess with me' vibe, with a thousand-yard Asian stare thrown in.
RORY: That should do it.
[They see a police car and a large crowd down the street in front of Doose's market]
RORY: What's happening up there?
CUT TO OUTSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET
[A crowd has gathered around the chalk outline.]
POLICEWOMAN: Just try to calm down Taylor.
TAYLOR: Calm down! Why should I calm down?
BOOTSY: Yeah, why should he calm down?
TAYLOR: I want action not words.
BOOTSY: Yeah, action not words.
TAYLOR: Don't you need to get back to your newsstand, Bootsy?
BOOTSY: No buddy, I'm all yours.
POLICEWOMAN: We're gonna get to the bottom of this, I promise you.
TAYLOR: A crime was committed right in front of my store.
POLICEWOMAN: Now, we can't say that for sure yet.
TAYLOR: How come you can't say that for sure? This is a police tape. You're the police, you own the tape!
POLICEWOMAN: Taylor, we've contacted everyone in the precinct. No one knows anything about this.
TAYLOR: Well, what am I supposed to do? I've got a dead body right in front of my store!
POLICEWOMAN: No, you have a chalk outline of a dead body in front of your store.
BOOTSY: Meaning that there were two crimes.
POLICEWOMAN: What?
BOOTSY: What do you mean what? Somebody got m*rder*d, then somebody stole the body. It's open and shut, bing bang boom.
POLICEWOMAN: Is this your son?
TAYLOR: I should say not.
BOOTSY: Oh.
POLICEWOMAN: Look, my partner's doing a headcount to see if anyone in town is missing. Until then, just hang tight. [leaves]
[Rory and Lane walk up to Dean in the crowd.]
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: What's going on?
DEAN: I don't know. I got here and this is what I found. I mean, I told him it looked fake, but he didn't believe me.
RORY: And you have such an honest face.
DEAN: Well, he must not love me as much as you do.
LANE: Okay, you two are officially sickening. [leaves]
[The policewoman walks up to Taylor]
POLICEWOMAN: Everyone's accounted for Taylor. It looks like this is just an elaborate prank.
TAYLOR: But it looks so real. Where'd they get the police tape?
POLICEWOMAN: Kids have their ways.
TAYLOR: Who'd be depraved enough to pull a stupid prank like this?
POLICEWOMAN: Hard to say.
[Rory sees Jess standing across the street smirking as he watches the crowd]
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Rory is sitting at a table doing work, Lorelai is getting coffee, Sookie is cooking.]
RORY: Mom, you're not writing what you purchased on the back of any of the inn's credit cards receipts.
LORELAI: Oh, well, just put cooking spray and sponges.
RORY: Okay. And when an auditor wants to know why you need such large amounts of cooking spray and sponges?
LORELAI: Then I drop my pencil and I put the scoop neck sweater that I'm now making a mental note to wear to good use.
RORY: Well at least you've got a solid well thought out plan.
SOOKIE: I had a dream last night about us and Fran.
LORELAI: Oh, what was it?
SOOKIE: Well, it was in the future and we were all old, you and me and Rory and Jackson and Michel, everyone. Gray hair, walking around with canes, we're all kind of ailing, you know? I had those big cataract glasses on. You were hard of hearing and kept going, Huh? Huh?
LORELAI: Oh, that's attractive.
RORY: Its you kids with your rock and roll.
SOOKIE: But wuh-ho, here walks up Fran, and guess what. She looks exactly the same, even better.
LORELAI: Ugh! That's not fair.
SOOKIE: That woman is gonna live forever.
LORELAI: Not necessarily. Hey, did you look up angina? I forgot to.
SOOKIE: Yeah, it's nothing major.
RORY: You guys have got to stop talking like this.
LORELAI: Like what?
RORY: We love Fran, remember? Fran is great.
SOOKIE: No, honey, of course we love Fran. We just wanna know what God's little plan is for her, that's all.
[Michel walks into the kitchen]
MICHEL: I would advise at least pretending to look busy, the boss is here.
RORY: Mia!
LORELAI: You're kidding! When?
MICHEL: I just spotted her walking in.
LORELAI: Let's go.
CUT TO LOBBY
[Lorelai and Rory walk out from the kitchen over to Mia.]
RORY: Mia!
MIA: Uh! Oh my babies! Ooh! [hugs them]
RORY: Did we know you were coming?
MIA: I didn't know I was coming.
LORELAI: This isn't a surprise inspection is it?
MIA: That's exactly what this is. Ready? Oh, you're too thin as always.
RORY: But we eat.
MIA: And you're both too beautiful.
LORELAI: Yes, that's true. We often feel guilty monopolizing the amount of beauty we're in possession of.
MIA: And I don't see you enough which is my fault, so you both pass.
LORELAI: Aww.
[Michel walks over to them]
MIA: Ooh Michel. Ooh, how nice to see you. Uh, and look at that suit. You are quite the dandy, aren't you?
MICHEL: Well, I had a feeling that a lovely woman was going to be visiting today so I decided I must look my best for her.
MIA: I'm sorry honey, I didn't catch a word of that.
RORY: He said he missed you.
MIA: You've been in the U.S. quite some time Michel, your enunciation really should be better by now.
MICHEL: The customers seem to understand me just fine.
MIA: I didn't get that either. Did you get the tapes I sent you?
LORELAI: Hey, maybe you should hit the desk. A couple of people are looking for help.
MICHEL: Right away. Mia, uh, I. . . [salutes and walks behind the desk]
MIA: So, are you too busy to sneak out with me for a walk?
RORY: Not if it's okay with the boss.
MIA: It's a demand at this point.
LORELAI: Let's go. Michel, hold down the fort?
MICHEL: Oh, it's a little slow now, so it's no problem.
RORY: Oh, he says that he's never liked you and that you're a problem.
MICHEL: I said no such thing!
MIA: I don't know where this hostility comes from. Can we work this out?
MICHEL: There's nothing to work out.
RORY: He told you to get out.
MICHEL: I did not!
MIA: I don't know what I did to make him hate me.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is at the counter fixing a toaster as Lorelai, Rory and Mia walk in]
MIA: Look at this place, it's exactly the same.
LORELAI: Actually, I made him paint it a few months ago.
MIA: Well, good for you.
[Luke walks over and hugs Mia]
LUKE: Mia hey!
MIA: Nice to see you Lucas.
LUKE: You're the only person in the world who can call me that, Mia.
MIA: I know this.
LUKE: I'm saying it for others who plan to try it later.
LORELAI: Whatever Lucas.
LUKE: Mia, you know anything about toasters?
MIA: Not a damn thing.
LUKE: Well, then sit down and let me get you some coffee.
[Luke goes to get coffee as they sit down at a table.]
LORELAI: So, Mia, how's living in Santa Barbara?
MIA: Horrible. Did you know the damn sun shines all the time out there?
RORY: They've written songs about that.
MIA: Well, no one told me that's how it was. Half of my wardrobe is obsolete.
LORELAI: Aw, drag. Hey, you know that vintagey blue coat?
MIA: You're not getting it.
LORELAI: Right.
[Jess walks up to Luke, who's fixing the toaster again.]
JESS: You're making that worse.
LUKE: Big help, thanks.
LORELAI: Luke's nephew.
MIA: Luke, that's your nephew?
[Luke brings their coffee to the table]
LUKE: It's Liz's kid. Jess, this is Mia, she owns the Independence Inn.
JESS: Huh.
LUKE: That's 'Hello, nice to meet you' in slacker.
JESS: You don't need me down here, do you? [leaves]
LUKE: I'm sorry Mia. He's just
MIA: Oh please, forget it. You weren't exactly a talkative boy yourself when you were his age.
LORELAI: That's right, you knew Luke as a boy.
RORY: I can't imagine Luke as a boy.
LUKE: Can we change the subject?
MIA: He would help people carry groceries home.
RORY: Oh, how very Boy Scout-y of you.
MIA: For a quarter a bag.
LORELAI: Oh, how very John Birch Society-y of you.
MIA: He was never without his skateboard for a time.
LORELAI: Were you any good?
LUKE: I could hold my own.
MIA: And there was that year you wore the same shirt everywhere you went.
LUKE: I don't remember that.
LORELAI: Must have been something flannel.
MIA: No, it was from that TV show. That famous one.
LUKE: It's not important.
MIA: Star Trek, that's it!
[Lorelai and Rory laugh]
LORELAI: Oh my God, oh my God!
LUKE: Stop it.
RORY: You were a Trekkie?
LUKE: I was not a Trekkie.
LORELAI: Uh uh, I do believe that denying you were a Trekkie is a violation of the prime directive.
RORY: Indubitably captain.
LUKE: It was a gift from my aunt, I wore it to make her happy.
LORELAI: I've never wanted to make any aunt of mine that happy.
MIA: Did I say something I shouldn't have?
LORELAI: Oh no Mia, that's okay. I just have to cancel everything I have scheduled for the next three months 'cause I'll still be laughing my ass off.
[Taylor walks into the diner.]
TAYLOR: Luke, I need to talk to you right now.
LUKE: What is it Taylor?
TAYLOR: I have conducted a thorough investigation of all the people who may have inadvertently been witness to the phony m*rder at my store last night.
MIA: There was a phony m*rder?
LORELAI: Yeah, the town's too dull to work up a real m*rder.
RORY: But you're one 'beam me up Scotty' reference away from being the victim of one.
LORELAI: Mm.
TAYLOR: Luke, are you going to listen?
LUKE: What's this got to do with me?
TAYLOR: Three people have reported seeing Jess in that area late last night, skulking, lurking.
LUKE: There were a lot of people out late last night. I know because I fed some of them. I'll give you their names so you can add them to your suspect list.
TAYLOR: Another person witnessed Jess walking out of an arts and crafts store two days ago with what appeared to be chalk.
LUKE: You appear to be bugging me Taylor.
TAYLOR: What are you gonna do about it Luke?
LUKE: About what?
TAYLOR: About the results of my investigation.
LUKE: Absolutely nothing, but thanks for the info.
TAYLOR: You have to do something. People want action.
LUKE: People, meaning you.
TAYLOR: Not just me. I speak for the Stars Hollow Business Association, the Stars Hollow Tourist Board, the Stars Hollow Neighborhood Watch Organization, and the Stars Hollow Citizens for a Clean Stars Hollow Council.
LUKE: All of which are you.
TAYLOR: So are you going to act.
LUKE: Yes I am. I'm gonna act like you never came in here.
TAYLOR: Fine, have it your own way. But I warn you, there's gonna be a lot of unhappy people at S.H.B.A., the S.H.T.B., the S.H.N.W.O. and the S.H.C.C.S.H.C.
LUKE: F-I-N-E.
TAYLOR: Oh, you're. . .you're impossible, you are impossible! [starts to leave] Oh, hi Mia.
MIA: Nice to see you Taylor. [Taylor leaves] Ah, I gotta get out of Santa Barbara. I miss the small town theater. And I miss you. Hey, do you realize it was fifteen years ago almost to the day?
LORELAI: Yes it was.
RORY: What was?
MIA: To the day when this skinny little teenage girl showed up at the inn. She had this tiny little thing in her arms.
LORELAI: A little thing named Rory. [pinches Rory's cheeks]
RORY: Okay, no physical reenactments.
MIA: You marched up to me, looked me right in the eye and said, 'I'm here for a job. Any job.'
LORELAI: Well, IBM had turned me down for the CEO slot, so I was desperate.
MIA: Work experience none, recommendations none, skills
LORELAI: Besides flawlessly applying mascara in a moving car, none.
MIA: Not one thing to recommend hiring her. Just thathow do I put it and remain a ladythat 'who cares' look in her eyes, so I gave her any job. The other maids hated you.
LORELAI: Yeah, well they were all so slow.
MIA: You were special.
RORY: Mia, why don't you move back here? We miss you.
LORELAI: Or at least visit more? You used to check in. You never come at all.
MIA: I don't have to. You've made me redundant.
LORELAI: I have not.
MIA: Don't be humble. The inn is beyond covered. It's never run this well or been this successful. That inn is like your place now. Without you I wouldn't know what to do, I'd be lost.
LORELAI: Lost, yeah.
RORY: Yeah.
MIA: You look sad now, why?
LORELAI: Oh, nothing.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Sookie is cooking while Lorelai talks to her.]
LORELAI: In all the excitement, I hadn't thought about telling Mia. What is wrong with me?
SOOKIE: Nothing is wrong with you.
LORELAI: I feel terrible. I should've told her before. I should've told her the day the idea occurred to us. She deserved that. [phone rings] After all she's done for me. [answers phone] Hello?
EMILY: Lorelai, your daughter's being impossible. She won't pose in an appropriate manner.
RORY: I'm trying to Grandma. It's just awkward.
LORELAI: Let me guess how you're posing her. She's in a silly gown on a silly chair with both of her hands raised in some silly way.
EMILY: No, just the one hand is raised, and none of it's silly.
LORELAI: Pick a simpler pose, Mom.
EMILY: This is the simplest, and it wasn't my choice.
LORELAI: And your choice is
EMILY: I wanted the swan to sit regally aside Rory's throne.
LORELAI: Swan? Throne?
EMILY: Oh, now you have a problem with swans and thrones.
LORELAI: Because swans and thrones scream one thing Mom, Siegfried and Roy.
EMILY: Who?
LORELAI: Make a change Mom.
EMILY: I suppose you'd just have her sitting in a chair reading a book.
LORELAI: Now that sounds great.
EMILY: Oh, be serious.
LORELAI: I am. That's a completely natural pose for Rory. And a painting of her reading that's gonna be hung in Dad's study seems just crazy enough to work.
EMILY: Well, maybe it's not such a bad idea.
LORELAI: Give it a try. And let her lower her arm.
EMILY: Rory, you can lower your arm.
RORY: Thanks.
[swan honks]
EMILY: I think he's just hungry. We're going to lose the swan.
LORELAI: Good going Mom. Bye. [hangs up] Ugh. So how do I do this? How..howhow do I tell Mia that I'm leaving?
SOOKIE: Get her drunk first?
LORELAI: Oh, I can't believe it. I'm gonna let down the one person in my life who was there for me when I needed it the most. I'm great, aren't I?
[Mia and Michel enter the kitchen]
MIA: I wanted to put it on the front desk but I think it might be a tad short.
MICHEL: Well, we could get a carpenter to build up a base and raise it up two inches and then it would be perfect.
MIA: Great idea. Hey, I got that, every word!
MICHEL: Yes!
MIA: Oh, oh, I'm so proud!
[Michel and Mia leave]
SOOKIE: So you gonna tell her now or later?
LORELAI: Later, because she's so happy that she can finally understand Michel and that the lamp is fixed and that...
SOOKIE: [clucks like a chicken]
LORELAI: And that too.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai, Rory, and Mia walk down the street towards Miss Patty's]
RORY: We're late.
LORELAI: We're not late.
RORY: The last time we were late, Taylor said that there would be consequences.
LORELAI: He did not. He said there would be severe consequences.
RORY: Mia, what time is it? Are we late?
MIA: I hope so.
LORELAI: Mia!
MIA: I'm sorry, but it's been two years since I've gotten to go to a town meeting and I want some controversy.
[Lorelai sees Luke in front of the diner, locking up]
LORELAI: Aha!
LUKE: Geez! Don't sneak up on me like that.
LORELAI: Yeah, boy, I was lucky you had your phasers on stun, huh?
RORY: Well, at least we're not late. Luke's never late.
LUKE: Actually, we're 2 minutes early.
RORY: Ha! We should get a prize for being on time.
LORELAI: Hey Luke, let's go back to the diner and get some pie as our reward for being on time.
LUKE: Then you'd be late.
LORELAI: A funny conundrum, but I want pie.
LUKE: You're harassing me now.
LORELAI: I'm not harassing you. We're your groupies. [in high voice] Oh Luke, you're so dreamy, be my guy!
RORY: [in high voice] No, be my guy!
LUKE: I'm bringing up the need for more police protection at this thing.
[they walk into the town meeting, which has already started]
MIA: I think we're late.
LUKE: What's going on here?
TAYLOR: Uh, nothing.
LUKE: Meeting was supposed to start at eight Taylor, it's a minute to eight.
TAYLOR: Well...
MISS PATTY: Oh, you might as well be honest with him Taylor.
LORELAI: Be honest with him about what?
TAYLOR: Well, if you must know, there was a special issue that the business community had to deal with first, so we decided to start early tonight.
LUKE: I'm in the business community and I wasn't told about it. Taylor?
TAYLOR: All right, fine. You weren't invited Luke.
LUKE: And why is that?
MIA: Controversy.
TAYLOR: You weren't invited because we are dealing with the Jess situation.
LUKE: The Jess situation?
LORELAI: Uh oh. If this was the wild west, we'd be pushing the horse aside and diving into the water trough right about now.
LUKE: Dammit Taylor!
MISS PATTY: Luke, honey, calm down.
TAYLOR: After all, this is all your doing. If you hadn't so cavalierly dismissed the issue, we wouldn't have had to do this. I lost business because of what your hooligan nephew did.
LUKE: How was business lost Taylor? If you had to open a little late that day, your customers just came back later.
TAYLOR: Not so. When Mrs. Lanahan couldn't buy her head of lettuce that morning for her lunch, she drove straight to Woodbury to buy lettuce from a competing market. Isn't that right Mrs. Lanahan? Mrs. Lanahan?
LORELAI: You really shouldn't be driving anymore.
TAYLOR: Word has it that she was telling other Doose market shoppers that Woodbury lettuce is crisper. That's business flying out the door.
LUKE: Okay fine. How much is a head of lettuce, a buck? Oh, let's go crazy, give me five heads.
TAYLOR: This goes well beyond a head of lettuce, young man. The charges against your nephew are numerous. He stole the 'save the bridge' money...
LUKE: He gave that back.
TAYLOR: He stole a gnome from Babette's garden.
LUKE: Pierpont was also returned.
MISS PATTY: He hooted one of my dance classes.
FRAN: He took a garden hose from my yard.
MAN: My son said he set off the fire alarms at school last week.
LORELAI: I heard he controls the weather and wrote the screenplay to Glitter.
BOOTSY: I think it's time for me to pipe up here.
LUKE: Oh yeah, that'll be good.
BOOTSY: I have every right to pipe in here Luke. I'm a local entrepreneur.
LUKE: You took over your father's newsstand Bootsy, it doesn't make you an entrepreneur.
BOOTSY: And you took over your old man's hardware store.
LUKE: And turned it into a diner.
BOOTSY: Big whoop. Who can't fry an egg?
TAYLOR: Let's keep it moving here boys, huh?
BOOTSY: I never liked the look of that kid from the second I saw him.
LUKE: Unbelievable.
BOOTSY: Excuse me, but I've got the floor.
LUKE: You don't have the floor.
BOOTSY: I'm standing, aren't I?
LUKE: Well I was standing first which means I have the floor and I'm not giving it to you.
TAYLOR: What is with you too?
BOOTSY: This goes way beyond the Jess matter Taylor. Luke's been on my case since the first grade when he wrongfully accused me of sabotaging a clay imprint that he made of his hand.
LORELAI: Ooh! Think hard, was he dressed like Sulu?
LUKE: No one cares about the stupid clay hand Bootsy. And you stomped on it while it was drying. Three kids saw you.
BOOTSY: No I didn't.
LUKE: You did too!
BOOTSY: No I didn't.
TAYLOR: Boys, please. The bottom line here is that there is a consensus among townspeople who are in agreement that Stars Hollow was a better place before Jess got here.
LUKE: So this half of the room gets the tar, and the other half gets the feathers?
TAYLOR: Well, there hasn't been any talk of tar and feathers. Although
LUKE: Look, I've lived in this town my entire life, longer than most everybody here.
BOOTSY: I beg to differ. I'm five weeks older than you, that means I've been here five weeks longer.
LUKE: I've never bothered anyone. I've kept to myself and I've done the best I could. I pay my taxes, and I help people when I can. I haven't pitched in on the decorative pageantry town stuff because it all seems insane to me, but I don't get in the way of that stuff either.
TAYLOR: What's your point, Luke?
LORELAI: His point isdo you mind?
LUKE: Be my guest.
LORELAI: His point is, that if there's a problem
LUKE: And I'm not saying there's a problem.
LORELAI: Right, he's not saying there is a problem, but if there it, give him time to deal with it before you storm his diner with torches and pitchforks.
LUKE: Right. What I'm dealing with, being a problem, that I don't necessarily agree that I even have.
LORELAI: Right.
TAYLOR: I didn't get that last part.
LORELAI: Lay off him because what you're all doing stinks.
LUKE: I'm done here. I'm done with all of you. Oh, and I was gonna stay open later in case anyone wanted to eat after the meeting. Forget that. [leaves]
BOOTSY: His turkey burgers are very dry.
CUT TO OUTSIDE MISS PATTY'S
[Lorelai, Rory and Mia walk out of the town meeting.]
MIA: Well, I must say that was quite exciting.
LORELAI: A little disturbing. I think the whole town needs a field trip.
RORY: Do you think Luke's okay?
LORELAI: I think he will be. He just needs to cool off a little.
RORY: Hey, I'm gonna go check on Dean. He's been scraping that outline off the cement for two days now.
LORELAI: Good idea. There's nothing like your face on his to make the cleaning process go faster.
RORY: She's all yours Mia.
MIA: I'll take her.
LORELAI: Bye hon. [Rory leaves]
MIA: Oh, I am just having the most wonderful time. And I am so proud of you and Rory. You both have just come so far.
LORELAI: Yeah, we have. Um, Mia, I need to talk to you about something.
MIA: Of course. What is it, honey?
LORELAI: Well, um, it's really hard, and uh, I should've brought it up ages ago, but Sookie and I are thinking of making a change.
MIA: A change?
LORELAI: We're going to open our own inn.
MIA: Oh!
LORELAI: I mean, we've talked about it for a long time and it seems like the time is right andOh Mia, I love the Independence Inn and Sookie loves it too and we both love you so much.
MIA: I know.
LORELAI: But it just feels like something we need to do andyou hate me.
MIA: No I don't.
LORELAI: I'm letting you down. I'm walking out. I'm being ungrateful.
MIA: Lorelai, stop. Do you think I was naïve enough to think that you'd work for me forever? You and Sookie have more talent for this business than I do. And I'm very good. You're going to open an incredible place, and if you don't let me help you in any way I can, then I'll be very mad.
LORELAI: Of course, we need your help. We'd be lost without your help.
MIA: Good. I was just wondering, what's the time frame for this big move?
LORELAI: Well, we're waiting for this perfect location to free up, that's all that's delaying us. But I promise you'll have plenty of notice and I'll be there to find our replacements and train them.
MIA: Oh yes, that's very sweet of you, but I'm wondering if you could possibly make it sooner rather than later?
LORELAI: What?
MIA: Well, you see, your leaving gives me the perfect excuse to finally sell the place.
LORELAI: Sell the place?
MIA: Oh, I get offers all the time, lucrative ones, but I never even considered it because. . . oh, of course I love the inn, but I just couldn't do that to you. And now that you have this big change coming up in your life, it might be time for one in mine.
LORELAI: Oh. Good, uh, good. Then it all works out good.
MIA: Actually, it's very good!
LORELAI: Okay. Wellgood.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Lorelai sits at a table in the lobby organizing placecards as Sookie walks over to her with a piece of paper]
LORELAI: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey. So I'm working on the menu for the Duncan wedding.
LORELAI: I can't read that.
SOOKIE: I know. I had it all typed up nice and neat to begin with but on the drive into work, I got an inspiration. I just started crossing it out and writing in the new stuff. And it ain't easy writing and driving, andI can't read that. What is that - cumin?
LORELAI: Sookie, I can't read that either.
SOOKIE: Oh. I'll just get you a new one. Hey, how did your talk with Mia go?
LORELAI: Fine. Good. She took it like you said she would - classy.
SOOKIE: She is classy. Good, good. That's a relief. It is a relief right? I mean, you said she took it good?
LORELAI: Yes she did.
SOOKIE: But you look upset.
LORELAI: She's gonna sell the inn.
SOOKIE: You're kidding.
LORELAI: No, she said she gets offers and she thinks this might be kind of fortuitous timing for her.
SOOKIE: Well, great, so everybody wins, that's good. Look happy. Okay, this does not look happy.
LORELAI: I just don't understand how she can do this.
SOOKIE: What's the big deal?
LORELAI: The big deal isshe's not gonna sell it to another Mia. It's gonna be a big chain, and they'll come marching in with their business models and their corporate approved architects and designers, and change everything around and remodel, and the place will lose all its personality and charm.
SOOKIE: Well, I hope they don't do that, but hey, our place is gonna be full of charm.
LORELAI: So you don't care what happens to this place?
SOOKIE: Of course I do, but it's not up to me. I mean, I can't control that. The only thing we can control is what our inn's gonna be like.
LORELAI: I guess.
SOOKIE: You guess what?
LORELAI: We'll see.
SOOKIE: We'll see what?
LORELAI: It's just a little short sided to just write off this place when we haven't even bought Fran's yet and, hey, we don't know if we will.
[Lorelai walks to the dining room, Sookie follows her.]
SOOKIE: We don't? Why wouldn't we? Lorelai. Is this about Fran's life expectancy because I
LORELAI: No Sookie, it's about the fact that we haven't even looked at any other places and we don't know if that's necessarily the right one and we have to be very practical about this.
SOOKIE: But it's the perfect location. We all said so.
LORELAI: Well, you can't get emotionally attached to any of our decisions about the inn. This is business. You've got to stay detached.
SOOKIE: But we are all so not detached. Butokay, do you have another location in mind?
LORELAI: Not really.
SOOKIE: Do you wanna look for a new location?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, like I have all this time to go looking for other locations.
SOOKIE: Well, I don't know. Should we try to buy this place?
LORELAI: Aha. This place is five times what we can afford.
SOOKIE: So what do we do?
LORELAI: I don't know. It's on hold, I guess.
SOOKIE: Well, it's been on hold for years. We were moving forward.
LORELAI: Yes, well, I'm looking at the economy right now and I'm thinking, I don't know if the timing's good.
SOOKIE: Okay, that's not fair because I don't know anything about the economy.
LORELAI: Oh, well then good thing you hooked up with me because it's not looking good.
SOOKIE: Okay, what happened?
LORELAI: What do you mean, what happened?
SOOKIE: We had a vision, we had a plan. You're the one that got this whole ball rolling again, and I jumped on the ball, and then we were rolling on the ball together and then you hopped off the ball, and I'm still on the ball. And I'm confused, 'cause I see it, and I see our vision, and you saw it too up until today!
LORELAI: Well, I know you would like things to be simple and straightforward but unfortunately things are more complicated.
SOOKIE: Okay, that's why we'd be partners. If something gets too heavy for the one person, the other one's there to pick up the slack.
LORELAI: Yes, well that's great in theory, but I gotta tell you, my back is aching from all the extra slack I'm taking up!
SOOKIE: What did I do that's so wrong?
LORELAI: Let's not get into this stuff.
SOOKIE: No, get into it.
LORELAI: Well, you're not the most reliable person in the world or the most punctual.
SOOKIE: You've always known that about me.
LORELAI: Yes, but now, getting into business, it's not so cute. It could hurt us. I mean, you were late for the Fran meeting, you're constantly changing every menu you ever set, even after you've started making it.
SOOKIE: I don't believe this! Before it was kudos to me for my attention to detail. I was the maestro.
LORELAI: That's fine for an established place like the Independence, but you do that stuff at our place, it could wipe us out. Profit margins in a new business are slim, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Just stop. Just stop. Now you're talking down to me.
LORELAI: I'm not talking down to you, I'm trying to explain.
SOOKIE: Yes you are. Yes you are, and I don't know why you are, but I don't want to start crying in front of you because it'll just give you one more thing to point at to say, 'Look, she's too emotional and she's too weak for me to go into business with,' so I'm leaving. And I'll see you tomorrow, if I can remember to show up.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
[Rory and Dean are walking down the street.]
DEAN: Hey, I gotta drop by the market.
RORY: But it's your day off.
DEAN: Yeah, it's to get my paycheck. If I don't get it by four, Taylor locks it in a safe and it's on some kind of timer and then when I complain, he lectures me about promptly putting checks in the back and the theories of compound interest, and then my head hurts from all the nodding I do even though I don't listen
RORY: Go, go!
DEAN: I'll just be a minute.
[Dean walks into the market. Rory waits outside. Jess walks up to her.]
JESS: Should you be standing here all alone? I hear this is a pretty dangerous corner.
RORY: I'm fine.
JESS: Feeling succinct today?
RORY: Pretty much.
JESS: Hmm. Did I do something to offend?
RORY: Me?
JESS: Yeah.
RORY: No.
JESS: Good.
RORY: You might want to ask that same question to Luke though.
JESS: Meaning?
RORY: You've got this whole town down on him.
JESS: Really? How did I do that?
RORY: You know how you did that.
JESS: I'm not really familiar with the blue book laws in this town, so you can be talking about a lot of things. Dropping a gum wrapper, strolling arm in arm with a member of the opposite s*x on a Sunday. [Rory gestures to the chalk outline] Ah. What about it?
RORY: You did it. The whole town knows you did it. They had a meeting about it.
JESS: You actually went to that bizarro town meeting? Those things are so 'To k*ll a Mockingbird.'
RORY: Yes, I went. And Luke went. And when he got there, everyone ganged up on him. They all want you gone.
JESS: Wow, bummer.
RORY: And he's standing there yelling at everyone and defending you and paying Taylor back for his lettuce losses
JESS: Wait, his what?
RORY: And now Luke's a pariah and it's all because of you! What a shock, you don't care about any of this.
JESS: I didn't say that.
RORY: Go. I'm tired of talking to you.
JESS: Fine. [starts to walk away]
RORY: You care nothing about Luke and his feelings!
JESS: Got a second wind, huh? [walks back over to Rory]
RORY: All he does is stick up for you and all you do is make his life harder. I guess that's what you have to do when you're trying to be Holden Caulfield but I think it stinks. Luke has done a lot for my mom and a lot for me, and I don't like to see him attacked. Okay, second wind over.
JESS: I didn't know they were coming down so hard on him.
RORY: Funny, I never pegged you as clueless, my mistake.
JESS: Okay. I get it. No, no, I do, I get it. So did you at least think it was funny?
RORY: That is so not the point.
JESS: Ah, you thought it was funny.
[Dean walks out of the market]
DEAN: I got it. Oh, uh, hey.
RORY: Um Dean, I don't think you two have met. This is Jess. This is Dean.
JESS: Boyfriend?
RORY: Of course.
JESS: Sorry, you didn't say. How ya doing?
DEAN: Good, good.
RORY: Okay, see you around.
JESS: Seems to turn out that way, doesn't it?
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the front door]
RORY: I wonder if Grandpa's still in Akron?
LORELAI: Well for Akron's sake, I hope he's moved on to Boise. [rings doorbell; the maid answers] Hi. We're the daughter and the granddaughter.
[they walk inside]
RORY: You are majorly crabby.
LORELAI: I just have a headache.
EMILY: Oh Good! Come, come, come, it's all done, and it's great.
CUT TO STUDY
[they walk in and Emily shows them Rory's portrait]
EMILY: Tada.
RORY: Whoa.
EMILY: What do you think?
RORY: It's freaky.
EMILY: Freaky?
RORY: Well, just seeing me here, up on the wall like that, it's uh. . . I like it though. It's good, I guess. I should probably take myself out of the judging process.
EMILY: I think Richard's just gonna love it. It's the perfect thing, don't you think?
LORELAI: Mm hmm.
EMILY: You've got to admit, it turned out better than you thought it would.
LORELAI: Yeah.
EMILY: Well, come on, say a little more than that.
LORELAI: It's great Mom, it's fabulous. It's just a notch below Rembrandt.
EMILY: Well, you don't have to take that attitude.
LORELAI: What do you want from me? I'd light some sparklers and jump up and down yelling 'Yay for the painting' but I'm fresh out of sparklers and my feet hurt too much to jump. But I promise next week when I have more energy, I'll write a love song for the chandelier.
[Emily leaves the room]
RORY: Mom.
[Lorelai follows Emily]
CUT TO KITCHEN
[Lorelai walks over to Emily]
LORELAI: Hey, how dare you walk away from me when I'm being a world class jerk to you. The painting's great Mom, really.
EMILY: Thank you.
LORELAI: I really like it. It's so natural that she's reading which is great, and she's not sitting next to a goose or a giant tortoise, which is good, and Dad is gonna love it. It's a good thing you did here.
EMILY: You can be so harsh sometimes, and I just don't know where it comes from or what I've done to deserve it.
LORELAI: You did nothing.
EMILY: Well, I must've done something.
LORELAI: Oh, I've been...it's just been a bad week. Sookie and I were moving forward with plans to open our inn, and we had huge fight. And we've never had a huge fight, let alone a fight, and awful things were said and it all started when Mia showed up for a visit and I told her about our plans and she's talking about selling the Independence Inn and it just wigged me out a little. It's stupid, I don't know, but that was our home for so long, mine and Rory's. And it's just weird to think that it wouldn't be there and Mia wouldn't be there and I wouldn't be there, and I just got very upset. Anyway, I'm rambling. The painting's really great. Will you accept my apology?
EMILY: Yes, yes I will. I've had bad days too.
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: Well, we should get back to Rory.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table as Luke walks in.]
LUKE: Okay, I'm pretty much done.
LORELAI: Thanks for doing this. I didn't want the rain to destroy your beautiful chuppah. And I looked and looked in the yellow pages and I didn't see a chuppah waterproofer listing anywhere.
[Luke holds up a broken wooden goat]
LUKE: How about chuppah goat figure repairman?
LORELAI: Gilbert.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: The goat. We named him Gilbert, he's headless. Can you fix him?
LUKE: Yeah, I got some glue here. I can fix him.
LORELAI: Good. I'll make some tea.
LUKE: So, Sookie stopped at the diner this morning.
LORELAI: Oh.
LUKE: I asked her how your plans were going with the new inn, and she very awkwardly changed the subject to women's basketball.
LORELAI: Huh.
LUKE: She's never shown much interest in sports before.
LORELAI: No?
LUKE: What's going on with that?
LORELAI: Oh well, you know, women's basketball is getting super popular. That's good, I think. The tall girls need an outlet. We had a fight. A big, humongous fight. She's never going to speak to me again.
LUKE: What happened?
LORELAI: I just flat out panicked about the enormity of what we were getting into and it clobbered me, and I clobbered Sookie, and was such a jerk. Hey, if I cry, will it freak you out?
LUKE: Totally.
LORELAI: What if I whimper?
LUKE: How about you suck it up?
LORELAI: Hmm, I'll try.
LUKE: I don't get it. You're as ready as you've ever been.
LORELAI: Oh Luke, do not underestimate the complete and total lack of confidence I have in my abilities.
LUKE: What? You're the most confident person I know. Obnoxiously so.
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: I mean in a good way. You're good at what you do and you know it.
LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no. I'm good at doing what I have to do. When I had to get a job, I got it. When I had to find a house for us and a life for us, I got it. When I had to get Rory into Chilton, I did it. But I don't have to leave the Independence Inn. I don't have to go into business for myself, I don't have to walk out on that limb and risk everything I've worked for.
LUKE: Then do it.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Just say where you are.
LORELAI: What is this, reverse psychology?
LUKE: No, just stay at the inn. You're happy there.
LORELAI: Oh, so you think I can't hack it.
LUKE: Of course you can hack it.
LORELAI: Great, lip service, that's what I need.
LUKE: Hey, if I start to cry, will it freak you out?
LORELAI: Ugh. I couldn't stay where I am if I wanted. Mia is selling the inn. And that hit me hard too, maybe harder than the other thing. I'm gonna be without a home.
LUKE: What do you mean? This is your home.
LORELAI: No, I mean a home home. A memory home. The inn is where Rory took her first step. It's where I took my first step. It's more of a home to me more than my parents' house ever was.
LUKE: You're just scared. Just like everybody else when they're taking on something big.
LORELAI: Well, then what does everybody else do to get through this feeling?
LUKE: They run in the back, throw up, pass out and then smack their head on the floor.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: That's what I did on the first morning I opened the diner. Look, there is no button to push to get you through this. You just gotta jump in and be scared and stick with it until it gets fun.
LORELAI: How long 'til the diner got fun?
LUKE: About a year.
LORELAI: Wow. And there's no button?
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: How about a lever, can I pull a lever?
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: Turn a knob?
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: You just jump?
LUKE: You just jump.
LORELAI: I wanna do it.
LUKE: You should do it. Check it out. [holds up the fixed wooden goat]
LORELAI: Gilbert. You're not worse for the wear.
LUKE: I'll go reattach him. How'd this happen anyway?
LORELAI: Oh, something must've smacked into him with a hedger.
LUKE: Uh huh, well, no one'll ever know. Oh, and uh, women's basketball is in season. You might wanna run that news past Sookie, and maybe you can go to a game or something.
LORELAI: Yeah. Or something. Thanks.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Sookie is at the stove cooking as Lorelai walks over to her.]
LORELAI: Hi.
SOOKIE: Hi.
LORELAI: Mm. Meat loaf, mashed potatoes, stuffing. Comfort food, huh?
SOOKIE: I thought it would be good with the weather changing like this, but if you don't think it's right I can make something else. Although I'm right on schedule and on budget so a change would kinda throw things off. Your call.
LORELAI: No, no, everything looks great. Hey Sookie.
SOOKIE: Yeah?
LORELAI: I'm sorry about what happened. I said stupid things, and I said them for reasons that have nothing to do with you and I hate myself for doing it and I know you do too, and I am sorry.
SOOKIE: It's okay.
LORELAI: No it isn't. You are a brilliant chef and to think that you should do things differently from how you do them now is ridiculous. You don't tell a great violinist to hold his bow differently. You don't tell a great cymbal player to crash his cymbals differently. You just let them play.
SOOKIE: There are great cymbal players?
LORELAI: Theoretically.
SOOKIE: Okay, well, it's okay.
LORELAI: I wanna go ahead with our plans. Forget my freak out. Pretend it didn't happen. Let's move forward.
SOOKIE: Well
LORELAI: You don't want to move forward?
SOOKIE: No, I do. But I need your promise you're not gonna lose it on me again.
LORELAI: I promise.
SOOKIE: 'Cause I couldn't take losing a business partner and my best friend in one fail swoop. It'd be too much.
LORELAI: Sookie, I will place my hand on whatever you want and swear that you can trust that I will not lose confidence in our dream.
SOOKIE: That's good enough 'cause I know you don't like to put your hand on things.
LORELAI: We're gonna give it our best shot.
SOOKIE: And if we go down after two years
LORELAI: Oh, it'll be the most exciting two years of our lives!
CUT TO LOBBY
[Mia is talking to a man as Emily walks into the inn.]
MAN: How about antiques?
MIA: Absolutely, it's the best place for antiques. Michel will have a map for you if you need it.
MAN: Thank you.
[the man walks away as Mia walks over to Emily]
MIA: Hello, can I help you?
EMILY: No, thank you. I just
MIA: Yes?
EMILY: I just wanted to meet the woman who helped raise my daughter.
MIA: Emily.
EMILY: Yes, I'm Emily Gilmore.
MIA: I've wanted to meet you too for a very long time.
EMILY: Well, that's nice.
MIA: Would you like to sit down? Or have something to eat? Have lunch with me, won't you?
EMILY: No, thank you. You have a lovely place here. It's a beautiful hotel. It's not a home, but still, a beautiful hotel.
MIA: Sometimes home is where your hat is.
EMILY: Or where your family is.
MIA: Yes, that too. You sure you don't want some tea? Tea usually makes things like this a little less awkward. There's things to hold and stir.
EMILY: I don't know why I came here.
MIA: You wanted to meet me.
EMILY: After all these years, it makes no sense.
MIA: I expected you to come eventually.
EMILY: Did you?
MIA: Mm hmm.
EMILY: And what did you expect to say to me when I did come?
MIA: When Lorelai showed up on my porch that day with a tiny baby in her arms, I thought to myself, what if this were my daughter, and she was cold and scared and needed a place to live? What would I want for her? And then I thought, I'd want her to find somebody to take her in and make her safe and help her find her way.
EMILY: That's funny. I would've wanted her to find someone who would send her home. I have to go. I'd appreciate if you didn't mention this to Lorelai.
MIA: I won't.
[Emily walks to the door, then stops]
EMILY: Do you have pictures, from back then?
MIA: I'll send you a box full tomorrow.
EMILY: Thank you.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory sit at a table eating]
LORELAI: Oh man, it's such a relief to have that Sookie thing fixed.
RORY: I know. I hate fighting with friends.
LORELAI: That's what enemies are for.
RORY: And God knows we have our share of those.
LORELAI: People who eat crunchy food with their mouths open.
RORY: People who dog ear library books.
LORELAI: People who spit when they talk.
RORY: Oh gross, you got me in the eye!
LORELAI: I did not.
RORY: You totally did!
LORELAI: You're full of it.
RORY: Luke, where's my toast?
LUKE: Ah, it's gonna take awhile. My big toaster's broken so I got stuck with just this dinky one.
[Jess pushes down the handle on the big toaster, showing Luke that it works]
LUKE: How did that happen?
JESS: You're gonna break that.
LUKE: It was broken before.
JESS: Well it must've got better.
LUKE: Inanimate objects don't usually get better. Did you fix this?
JESS: Please.
LUKE: Jess.
JESS: I have no idea what you're babbling about. I don't fix things.
LUKE: But yesterday
JESS: I got school.
[Rory smiles at Jess as he leaves]

OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai and Rory are building a snowman in the center of town.]
LORELAI: How do you like that mouth?
RORY: Um, it's not very mouthlike.
LORELAI: Oh, I think it works.
RORY: It's tilted to the side.
LORELAI: Yeah, no, it was intentional. It gives her a unique expression.
RORY: Like she had a stroke?
LORELAI: Fine, I'll just use the Mrs. Potato Head lips.
RORY: No, forget it, leave stroke-mouth. It's not like we're gonna win this anyway.
LORELAI: Whoa, bad attitude.
RORY: Mom, face it. That is the single most incredible snowman I have ever seen. [looks at a man working on an elaborate snow sculpture]
LORELAI: I'm sorry, that snowman is way over the top, way too showy. It's screaming 'I'm incredible, I'm special, look at me.'
RORY: Kind of the point of a snowman-building contest.
LORELAI: Hmm, I hate this man with every fiber of my being.
RORY: He looks nice.
LORELAI: He's a ringer.
RORY: How do you figure?
LORELAI: Someone recruited him, promised him a handsome sum, financed his theatrical snowman accoutrements, so he could snatch victory away from a deserving local in order to bag the contest prize for himself.
RORY: Seems a little elaborate considering that the prize is a set of new US quarters.
LORELAI: Oh, we're ignoring him now. So, what are we gonna do on your school break?
RORY: A lot of nothing.
LORELAI: Sounds good.
RORY: Plus some homework.
LORELAI: And a lot of movies.
RORY: Oh, we have to rent Godfather 3 on DVD.
LORELAI: You're kidding.
RORY: In the audio commentary, Coppola actually defends casting Sofia.
LORELAI: Now that is fatherly love. What's all this homework you have to do?
RORY: Just stuff for the paper.
LORELAI: What? Why?
RORY: Because Paris wants the first issue back to be a double issue, so we have to prep over break and she says the news never sleeps.
LORELAI: What about Paris, does she ever sleep?
RORY: I think she periodically makes a whirring noise and then just shuts down.
LORELAI: Well, you can't work the whole time.
RORY: I won't, I promise. Oh my God.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: He's power buffing.
LORELAI: Aw, now that is just wrong.
RORY: We're competing against the Michelangelo of snow.
LORELAI: And we're Ernest Builds a Snowman.
RORY: We shouldn't look at him anymore.
LORELAI: Heads down, stay focused.
RORY: We can do this.
LORELAI: Absolutely.
[their snowman's head falls off]
RORY: Let's get some coffee?
LORELAI: Right behind you.

[Michel is at the front desk on the phone. In the background, Rune is jumping up and down trying to dust a picture frame.]
MICHEL: [oh phone] Yes, you can rent a car in Manhattan and return it in Hartford. That'sthat's no problem, sir. Yes. Yes, you can return it to Bradley International. That'sthat's very convenient. Or youyou canum, you - hold please. [puts phone down, walks over to Rune and grabs his arm]
RUNE: Ah!
MICHEL: Stop that.
RUNE: Stop what?
MICHEL: Stop jumping like a Mexican bean.
RUNE: Well, Lorelai asked me to dust the picture frames. How do you suggest that I clean the top, smartie? [Michel takes the picture off the wall] Well, I didn't know that you could do that.
MICHEL: Yes, I am miraculously talented, aren't I?
RUNE: I thought an alarm would go off like in The Thomas Crown Affair.
MICHEL: That would be if this was a museum, and you were a man allowed in museums.
LORELAI: Hey, no bickering in the lobby, guys.
RUNE: Where are we allowed to bicker?
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
SOOKIE: You've got all the mushrooms? You double checked?
JACKSON: I've triple checked. I've quadruple checked.
SOOKIE: The shitake, the nameko, the chanterelle?
JACKSON: Once again, I've got it all.
SOOKIE: The matsutake? The makeniya?
JACKSON: Uh wait.
SOOKIE: What?
JACKSON: I don't have makeniya.
SOOKIE: You don't have makeniya?
JACKSON: I don't have makeniya.
SOOKIE: I made it up. [giggles] You passed the test.
JACKSON: Don't test me.
[Lorelai walks in the kitchen]
LORELAI: Hey, the auditions are starting. You wanna come watch?
SOOKIE: Ooh, yes!
JACKSON: Auditions for what?
SOOKIE: Musicians.
LORELAI: For the Bracebridge Dinner.
JACKSON: Geez, you guys are going crazy with this dinner.
SOOKIE: Jackson, I told you, this dinner is not just about food. We are recreating an authentic 19th century meal.
LORELAI: The servers are all gonna be in period clothing, they're gonna speak period English. Here, look at the costumes.
JACKSON: Nice.
SOOKIE: We're talking seven courses here. Soup, fish, Peacock Pie, the Baron of Beef, the salad, then the Plum Pudding and the Wassail.
LORELAI: And there's gonna be a big raised platform where the Squire of Bracebridge is going to preside over the festivities.
SOOKIE: Yeah, he tastes the foods and makes pronouncements. He's like the host of the evening, and his costume is the coolest.
LORELAI: Ah.
JACKSON: It all sounds great.
SOOKIE: Oh, it is, it is. By the way, you're playing Squire Bracebridge. Ready?
LORELAI: Let's go.
SOOKIE: Yeah. [they leave]
JACKSON: Huh? What was that?
CUT TO LOBBY
SOOKIE: What are we looking at today?
LORELAI: Okay, this is the last on our list. We've already got our trumpets, our madrigal singers
JACKSON: Uh, sorry to interrupt but I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge.
LORELAI: We've got all our servers lined up. This is just for recorder players and harpists. Hi. Uh, lay some on us guys.
[two recorder players play]
SOOKIE: Hey, you cats really know how to blow those things.
LORELAI: You've got the gig. I will call you later with the details. Thanks.
[the recorder players leave]
JACKSON: So are we clear on this? I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge. Sorry you were under the impression that I'd do this.
SOOKIE: When do the guests arrive?
LORELAI: Thursday at four - on their own jet.
SOOKIE: After buying out the whole inn.
LORELAI: Must be nice to have money.
SOOKIE: Uh! Hey, you know what struck me today?
JACKSON: Was it the fact that I'm not the Squire - did that strike you?
SOOKIE: We are crazy for doing this.
LORELAI: We're beyond crazy. We are 'Anne Heche speaking her secret language to God and looking for the spaceship in Fresno' crazy.
SOOKIE: Oh Quiness, nokka don atta.
LORELAI: Il ek notra doska donne.
JACKSON: And springing this on me at the last minute too, I mean, that's just manipulative.
[a chef comes out of the kitchen]
CHEF: Sookie, fire! [leaves]
SOOKIE: I gotta get back in the kitchen. You'll handle the harp?
LORELAI: You got it.
JACKSON: All right, okay, I'll do it. I'll play Squire Bracebridge if that's what you want. Geez.
SOOKIE: Thanks Sweetie. [walks to kitchen]
JACKSON: As long as it's not just because I fit the costume. It's because I fit the costume, isn't it? [leaves]
LORELAI: [to harpist] Go ahead.
[Lorelai's cell phone rings while the harpist is playing]
LORELAI: [answers phone] Hi, it's Lorelai.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lor, it's me.
LORELAI: Oh, hi Chris, how are you?
CHRISTOPHER: Good, good. You, uh, got a minute?
LORELAI: Uh oh.
CHRISTOPHER: It's not an uh oh, I just wanted to run an idea by you.
LORELAI: Run it.
CHRISTOPHER: Now it's totally your call and I don't want to step on any plans you've already made, but I know Rory has a break in school coming up, and I was wondering if you'd be cool with her coming to visit for a couple of days.
LORELAI: Uhh, a couple of days? You mean she'd stay the night?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, it's totally your call. Where are you, heaven?
LORELAI: Do you even have room for someone to stay?
CHRISTOPHER: Not just room - a room. A designated guest room. Sherry fixed it up really nice.
LORELAI: Aww, good for her.
CHRISTOPHER: So what do you think?
LORELAI: I don't know. It's awfully last minute.
CHRISTOPHER: It's totally last minute. You can say no and there'll be no hard feelings.
LORELAI: Well, it's really up to Rory to say yes or no.
CHRISTOPHER: So you're cool with it?
LORELAI: Yeah, sure, if Rory is, yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Great, that's great. Uh, thank you. I'll let you run it past her and you can get back to me whenever. No pressure.
LORELAI: No pressure.
CHRISTOPHER: Talk to you later.
LORELAI: Yeah, talk to you later.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Emily, Richard, Lorelai and Rory are eating dinner silently. Rory get Lorelai's attention and gestures for her to say something.]
LORELAI: So what are your travel plans Dad?
RICHARD: Hmm?
LORELAI: You and mom, you always go out of town this time of year.
RORY: Last year it was the Bahamas.
RICHARD: Yes, that's right, it was.
LORELAI: I remember you had fun too. You said the Bahamamians were real nice. The Bahamites? The Bahamamamamians?
RORY: The Bahamians.
LORELAI: Yes. They were nice.
EMILY: They were nice.
LORELAI: So, what are your plans?
EMILY: We're not going anywhere this year.
RORY: Why not? Oh, well yeah, it can be really nice just to stay at home sometimes because you can do fun things that you normally wouldn't have time for.
LORELAI: Yeah, like play Running Charades, and get out that Slip 'n Slide.
RICHARD: We'll see.
EMILY: Yes, we'll see.
RICHARD: Would you all excuse me? I have to make some calls. Say goodbye before you leave, will you?
LORELAI: Yeah, sure Dad.
[Richard leaves]
LORELAI: When is this awfulness with work gonna resolve itself?
EMILY: I don't know. The man is so sensitive. He reads so much into every little perceived slight.
LORELAI: Yeah. I remember one time when I was a kid, Dad had put on some weight, and he bought a new suit to try to cover it up. And he wore it for us and he said, 'How do I look?' and I said, 'You look fat.' [pause] But I guess that wasn't really a perceived slightso, I'll think of another example.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN LOBBY
[Sookie is lecturing to a group of people; Kirk is transcribing everything she says on his laptop.]
SOOKIE: Keep in mind during the Bracebridge Dinner, we are not just servers, we are performers, so any time you're with a guest, you must be in character and you must speak Old English. It's a world we're creating here, so whatever we can doKirk, you're driving me crazy!
KIRK: Who me? [reads transcript] 'Whatever we can do to Kirk you're driving me crazy.' Yeah, me. Ah, sorry.
SOOKIE: Okay, now guys, look at the materials I gave you, and tell me if a guest asks you how the food's coming, what would be the appropriate Old English response? Rune!
RUNE: Greetings!
SOOKIE: You just read the first thing on the list, didn't you?
RUNE: Maybe.
SOOKIE: Guys, the correct response: Ah, oven's day with baked meat choke!
RUNE: Question?
SOOKIE: Yeah?
RUNE: What color dress will I be wearing when I say this?
JACKSON: Rune, don't be an idiot.
RUNE: Well, this is stupid.
JACKSON: Shut up and pay attention to Sookie. She worked very hard to bring this about.
KIRK: Yes, but unfortunately we don't all share intimacies with her, so she doesn't cut us any slack.
JACKSON: She doesn't treat me differently.
KIRK: She's called you Peaches three times. It's all in the transcript.
RUNE: Sookie, instead of talking in Old English, can I just talk like an old man?
SOOKIE: What?
RUNE: Hey you kids, get off my lawn!
SOOKIE: No, no you cannot just talk like an old man.
[Lorelai walks into the lobby]
SOOKIE: Hi, honey, what's the matter?
LORELAI: They're snowed in.
SOOKIE: Who's snowed in?
LORELAI: The Bracebridge group. They're stuck in Chicago. The dinner's off.
SOOKIE: No.
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: I'm gonna cry.
LORELAI: I offered to fund the instant invention of a molecular transport device but they just didn't go for it.
SOOKIE: Oh, that makes me so mad. And so sad. I'm smad!
RUNE: Sookie, does this mean that my pockets wileth not with money get choked? That sounded like Old English. Cool, huh?
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai, Sookie, and Rory are sitting at a table]
SOOKIE: I've got thirty pounds of aged beef, trays and trays of trout, mountains of pruned tarts. I diced pumpkins until my hands turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands.
LORELAI: Take a sip
SOOKIE: How can you stay so calm about this?
LORELAI: There's nothing we can do about it.
RORY: I can't believe they got snowed in.
LORELAI: All that work, all that extra help we hired. Oh well. At least they paid for it already. We didn't lose any money.
SOOKIE: Yeah I guess. You know, I could still make up the dinner for the three of us.
RORY: Yeah, but then it would be like the three of us, all alone in the dining room.
LORELAI: It would be like The Shining, except instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune.
[Luke walks over to them]
LUKE: You girls want anything besides coffee?
SOOKIE: Hey, what about Luke?
LUKE: What about him?
SOOKIE: He eats, and Jess eats. Doesn't Jess eat?
LUKE: What's she doing?
LORELAI: I think she's inviting you for dinner.
SOOKIE: Yeah, come on, join us. It'll be fun. You like Peacock Pie?
LUKE: I'm a hundred percent sure I don't.
LORELAI: There'll be normal food too.
RORY: And decorations.
SOOKIE: And music.
LORELAI: Come on, it'll be fun.
LUKE: Well
LORELAI: Hey, you know what? Let's invite everyone.
SOOKIE: Everyone who?
LORELAI: Everyone everyone.
SOOKIE: Everyone everyone who?
LORELAI: Everyone we know, everyone we like.
RORY: And they could even stay in the inn. All those empty rooms, all those uneaten pillow mints.
LORELAI: An out of control, over the top slumber party!
SOOKIE: I love it!
RORY: Me too!
LORELAI: Done! Spread the word.
LUKE: I haven't said I'd come yet so I'm certainly not gonna suddenly become your messenger boy. [Lorelai stares at him] Eight o'clock?
LORELAI: Seven.
LUKE: Right.

LANE: Deano.
DEAN: Hey Lane. Are you going to this big shindig at the inn tonight?
LANE: Yeah, I'm just trying to trick my mom into not going with me.
DEAN: How's that coming along?
LANE: How's that Pixies reunion coming along?
DEAN: Well, I'll see you and your mom there.
LANE: Bye.
DEAN: Bye.
[Lane leaves. Dean sees Jess fighting with another kid and goes over to break it up.]
BOY: Keep it up pal, you'll get hurt.
DEAN: Whoa, hey guys! Guys, come on, break it up guys! Quit it! Hey, hold it man, get off me! [Dean tries to pull Jess away; Jess tries to punch him] Whoa, hey, get off me man, I'm not fighting you! Jess, knock it off man! What the hell is your problem?
JESS: Nothing.
DEAN: You saw it was me, Jess. Why'd you keep punching?
JESS: Had momentum.
DEAN: Well I was trying to help you.
JESS: I don't need you help, but thanks for offering.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai sits on the couch as Rory walks in with some drinks.]
LORELAI: Hey, did Bootsy RSVP?
RORY: Yeah, he's coming.
LORELAI: Thanks. Is he bringing anybody?
RORY: He's coming solo.
LORELAI: Okay. I'm gonna put him in room 16 with Luke.
RORY: You can't do that.
LORELAI: Come on, let me have my fun.
RORY: Luke's coming with Jess.
LORELAI: Well, I'll put Jess in with Miss Patty.
RORY: There will be no Jess left in the morning.
LORELAI: You stink.
[Rory sits in the armchair and picks up a pile of cards]
RORY: Are these last year's cards or this year's?
LORELAI: This year's, of course.
RORY: Don't scoff. Last year's set were still sitting here 'til Halloween.
LORELAI: Hey, if that's a crack at my housekeeping skills...well then, okay.
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: This is one ugly looking baby. Whose baby is this?
LORELAI: That's your second cousin's Stan's. Poor kid.
RORY: Ugh, he got Stan's everything.
LORELAI: That's not even the ugliest baby in the bunch.
RORY: You're kidding. [looks through the pile] Ouch!
LORELAI: That's the ugliest baby in the bunch.
RORY: I don't understand why people put pictures on cards.
LORELAI: Do they not understand we are unapologetic mockers?
RORY: There's an unexplained innocence in the world. Hey, I didn't see this.
LORELAI: See what?
RORY: Dad.
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: And the woman I'm assuming is Sherry.
LORELAI: Uh, did I not show you that? Huh.
RORY: They've got a cute little puppy and everything.
LORELAI: Oh, I must've put it in the stack and forgotten to tell you about it. Well, there it is.
RORY: Nice looking lady.
LORELAI: Mm hmm. Like a young Tammy Faye Baker.
RORY: But prettier than that.
LORELAI: Oh, I didn't mean not pretty. Hey, question about the room list.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Room 31 - why is it empty?
RORY: Oh yeah, I wanted to run an idea by you.
LORELAI: Run it.
RORY: I thought maybe a certain depressed man and his wife could stay there.
LORELAI: Woody and Soon-Yi?
RORY: Grandma and Grandpa.
LORELAI: Ugh, you've got to be kidding.
RORY: But this could help to cheer him up.
LORELAI: I'll send him a Def Jam Comedy tape. That'll cheer him up.
RORY: It's a really good thing to do.
LORELAI: We'll donate money to charity, that's a good thing too. We'll stop kicking dogs.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: All right, I'll pencil them in, but they'll probably say no.
RORY: Yeah, but we're not gonna hope that they say no, right?
LORELAI: Right.
RORY: Right, because that would be really bad karma, especially on top of making fun of the ugly babies.
LORELAI: Uh, I have a new year's resolution for you: become more cynical and self absorbed.
RORY: I'll work on it.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[The night of the Bracebridge Dinner, Lorelai and Rory are in the lobby]
RORY: Hey, how's Sookie doing in there?
LORELAI: Ah, well, she's paper bagging it.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You know... [Lorelai breathes into a pretend paper bag]
RORY: Oh, so she's right on schedule.
[Babette and Morey walk into the inn.]
BABETTE: Hey dolls.
LORELAI: Hey!
RORY: Hi, welcome.
MOREY: Are we the first ones here?
LORELAI: Yes, you are.
BABETTE: Now don't you freak out. Morey hates being the first anywhere. He thinks it hurts his street credibility.
MOREY: Charlie Parker was late to everything.
BABETTE: Charlie Parker had more drugs in him than a Rite-Aid. Forget Charlie Parker.
RORY: You guys are in room 8. It's all ready for you.
BABETTE: Thanks, doll. C'mon Morey. We can be late for dinner if it'll make you feel better.
MOREY: A little.
BABETTE: Yeah.
[they walk away as Lane walks into the inn]
LANE: Hey!
RORY: Are you alone?
MRS. KIM: Lane!
LANE: My wedding night's gonna be very interesting.
RORY: Hi Mrs. Kim. I'm glad you guys could come. You guys are in room 12.
MRS. KIM: Thank you. Hello Lorelai, thank you for inviting us.
LORELAI: Our pleasure. Do you need help bringing in the rest of your stuff?
MRS. KIM: This is my stuff. Don't need any more stuff. People have too much stuff.
LORELAI: You know you're right. People have too much stuff. Absolutely.
[Mrs. Kim and Lane walk away]
RORY: Says the woman with 64 pairs of shoes.
LORELAI: Thus proving my point. What is Paris doing here?
RORY: She had to bring me the newspaper stuff tonight. She just couldn't wait.
LORELAI: A robot, she's a robot. Hi! [walks away]
RORY: Hey.
PARIS: So here are the materials in the double issue. Some of the articles are gonna need complete rewrites.
RORY: Drag.
PARIS: Madeline's 500 words on test anxiety spends 400 of them arguing that stretch corduroy is the best material for low-rise jeans.
RORY: Well, let's see. Corduroy is a fabric, and the fabric of society is weakened when students
PARIS: You can't get there.
RORY: Yeah, it doesn't look like it. I'll get right on this tomorrow.
PARIS: What about tonight?
RORY: I'm busy tonight.
PARIS: Doing what?
RORY: Well, this.
PARIS: Oh. What is this?
RORY: It's kind of a big dinner party.
PARIS: Oh. Okay, well, I'll get out of your way. Call if you need to talk things through, and oh - she uses the Prince version of writing. A letter U for you and a picture of an eye for an I.
RORY: Wow.
PARIS: Yeah.
RORY: Hey Paris, do you have anything going on tonight?
PARIS: What's that supposed to mean?
RORY: It's supposed to mean, do you have anything going on tonight?
PARIS: Well, my parents are out of town, so my Portuguese nanny will make dinner and then I'll either get back to reading the Iliad or we'll play Monopoly. I crush her every time.
RORY: Well I was just thinking, maybe you want to stay for dinner?
PARIS: Here?
RORY: Yeah. We have a ton of food, and it's like a whole big show and everything, and if you're not doing anything
PARIS: Rereading the Iliad a third time is not not doing anything. I'm not pathetic.
RORY: I know you're not. I just thought it might be fun, that's all.
PARIS: Well, I'll have to make a call.
RORY: Good, make it.
PARIS: I just have to let Nanny know. [takes out cell phone and dials] Nanny? É Paris. Vou jantar com Rory hoje à noite. Eu telefono no caminho de casa. Tchau.
[Dean and Clara walk into the inn]
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Hello there. Hey Clara. Nice, is that a Stella McCartney?
CLARA: It's a Wal-Mart.
RORY: Well, it's very pretty.
CLARA: My mom bought it for tonight.
RORY: She's got good taste.
DEAN: [sees Jess walk in] I didn't know he was coming.
RORY: Who?
DEAN: Jess.
RORY: Yeah. Is that a problem?
DEAN: Not really.
RORY: Dean.
DEAN: It's just that, he got into this fight with this guy at school, and when I broke it up he started in on me.
RORY: He hit you?
DEAN: He tried.
RORY: Why would he do that?
DEAN: Don't ask me to explain that jerk. [Jess waves] He better not do that all night.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
SOOKIE: No! It tastes too twentieth century guys. It's gotta shout Washington Irving, not Irving my accountant. It needs something, help me. What is it?
CHEF: Uhh
[Lorelai walks in]
LORELAI: How's it going? AGH!
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: Ooh! Ew, Rune naked, naked Rune.
[Rune is changing his pants in the corner]
SOOKIE: Ahh!
RUNE: These stupid pants won't go past my thighs.
LORELAI: Why are you dressing in here?
RUNE: The bathrooms are full and the lousy madrigal singers are bull guarding the supply closet so this is the only place.
SOOKIE: They're too small.
RUNE: My thighs are too big.
LORELAI: Ahh! Rune, yes, but in lieu of coming up with something that would immediately reduce the size of your thighs, why don't we get you a bigger pair of pants?
SOOKIE: And a different place to dress.
LORELAI: Definitely.
RUNE: Well, can you get me the supply closet?
LORELAI: We'll take it by force if we have to. Go. Ah. [Rune leaves] Is everything under control?
SOOKIE: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye...no. This needs something and I cannot think of what it is. It's that tart, kind of spicy, white. . .salt! The word is salt!
LORELAI: You forgot the word for salt?
SOOKIE: Everything's under control.
LORELAI: Good.
SOOKIE: Absolutely, one hundred percent.
LORELAI: You're exuding confidence. Have the oxygen ready.
SOOKIE: Okay, easy. It's a bird, it's a bird.
CUT TO LOBBY
[Lorelai walks into the lobby as Emily and Richard arrive]
LORELAI: They're here.
RORY: Who?
LORELAI: The Joy-less Luck Club.
RICHARD: Hello girls. You look particularly lovely tonight.
RORY: Thanks Grandpa.
LORELAI: Thanks Dad. You guys look nice yourselves.
EMILY: Seems like the occasion called for it.
RICHARD: The air seems crisper here than Hartford. It's wonderful.
LORELAI: Hey Dad, you didn't grab the wrong prescription bottle earlier today, did you?
RICHARD: What?
RORY: Nothing.
EMILY: I think she was making one of her funny jokes.
RICHARD: Oh, went straight over my head.
LORELAI: Let me get someone to help you with your bags.
RICHARD: No, no, I've got them. Just point me to the room.
RORY: You guys are in room 31, best room in the place.
RICHARD: Oh, anything's fine. I'll, uh, see you in a bit. [walks away]
LORELAI: What got into him?
RORY: He's totally different.
EMILY: I know. He's been that way for two days. I have no idea why but I'm taking the credit.
LORELAI: Ugh, a hostess' job is never done. Hi.
CUT TO LOBBY
[All the guests are mingling in the lobby.]
LORELAI: Hey everybody, will you gather round? Everyone, everyone! First of all, I want to welcome you to the first annual and probably never ever to be held again because Sookie's on the verge of a nervous breakdown Bracebridge Dinner.
SOOKIE: I'm fine, everything's fine.
LORELAI: I also want to thank Mother Nature for snowing in the Trelling Paper Company in Chicago so I can throw this great party for all my friends instead. It's a very special night. And so, since I don't get to eat unbelievably strange food with my friends everyday, I have arranged a little surprise. Outside, as we speak, is a line of horse drawn sleighs and everybody gets a ride. So, uh, line up and keep it orderly. There's two per sleigh and no cutting in front of each other - that goes for everyone. Except me, 'cause I'll be damned if I'm gonna miss a ride in a horse drawn sleigh. Come on.
LUKE: You gonna go?
JESS: I think I'll wait for the clog dancing.
DEAN: Hey, hey, don't move.
CLARA: But we're gonna miss all the good horses!
RORY: Who is this brazen woman competing for your attention?
CLARA: Come on!
DEAN: Uh, I guess I'm spoken for.
RORY: I'll see you back here.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai is sitting in one of the sleighs as Luke and Bootsy stand near the horses]
BOOTSY: You see the horses?
LUKE: You mean the ones three feet from my face? Yeah, I saw 'em.
BOOTSY: I spent a summer training horses in Montana.
LUKE: You get kicked in the head a lot?
BOOTSY: Just the once.
LORELAI: Hey, you in the belt - get in.
LUKE: What? Oh, no, I was just sort of checking things out.
LORELAI: Come on. We can pull a Ben Hur and take down Taylor's sleigh.
LUKE: I don't know, I...
LORELAI: Aww, come on Luke. I can't be all school marm-y and ride by myself. Please?
LUKE: Well, okay. [gets in the sleigh]
LORELAI: Giddy up. [the sleigh starts moving] Uh! The horses heard me, I speak horse language! I'm Dr. Dolittle!
LUKE: Plus, I think the driver of the sleigh heard you.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah.
LUKE: I gotta say, sleigh ride's a little much, but these horses are really beautiful.
LORELAI: Yes, especially from this angle.
LUKE: Not just from this angle.
LORELAI: Oh seriously, don't backtrack. Horse has got a nice butt there.
LUKE: It's not what I'm saying.
LORELAI: Nice firm hiney.
LUKE: Stop talking about the horse's hiney.
LORELAI: God, the town looks beautiful.
LUKE: Same as always.
LORELAI: No, it's always different his time of year. It's magical.
LUKE: If you say so, sure. Oh look, there's the magical plumbing supply store where I bought a magical float for my toilet last week.
LORELAI: You disappoint me.
LUKE: Oh look. There's the magical Luke's Diner right underneath the apartment that Jess magically lit by leaving every stinkin' light on.
LORELAI: How's it going with you guys?
LUKE: Me and Jess? Great.
LORELAI: Great? Really?
LUKE: Really.
LORELAI: Well, good.
LUKE: It is good. I mean, it was hard at first, seemed impossible, you know, but I've learned a lot these past couple months.
LORELAI: Like?
LUKE: Like last week I discovered the secret of parenting.
LORELAI: You did?
LUKE: Yup.
LORELAI: The secret of parenting?
LUKE: The secret of parenting.
LORELAI: When last week? Last Tuesday?
LUKE: I don't know the exact day.
LORELAI: Tuesday at 5:15, is that when you discovered the secret of parenting?
LUKE: Don't mock.
LORELAI: Well, tell me. What is. . . oh wait, it's a secret, you can't tell me.
LUKE: No, I'll tell you. You visualize the reality you want.
LORELAI: You visualize the reality you want.
LUKE: And then if necessary, you lie to bring it about.
LORELAI: That is so much worse than I was expecting.
LUKE: You never lied to your kid?
LORELAI: Ahh, to save her from great physical pain, yes. When she was little and she would play in the kitchen, I told her that the burners were the devil's hands, but I would say it in a really scary evangelist voice, you know, 'Don't touch the devil's hands!' She still doesn't go near the stove.
LUKE: Yes, exactly. You told a little white lie for your kid's protection, very similar to what I've done.
LORELAI: Which was?
LUKE: Well, you know the winter break is coming up?
LORELAI: Yes I do.
LUKE: Okay, well that means Jess has some time off from school. His mom knew that and she never called.
LORELAI: Ugh, it makes me sick
LUKE: So I decided just to keep Jess with me, and I told him that his mom wanted him to come home but I thought since he just got there and was still adjusting that I thought he should stay, and his mom was really upset but I insisted. He bought it hook, line and sinker. Saved him a lot of hurt.
LORELAI: He didn't buy it.
LUKE: What? Of course he did.
LORELAI: He knows.
[cut to Richard and Emily's sleigh]
EMILY: I wish Lorelai had warned us about this.
RICHARD: What? This is wonderful..
EMILY: It's wreaking havoc with my hair.
RICHARD: Oh this is not bad for your hair, compared to the other thing.
EMILY: What other thing? [Richard tousles her hair] Richard, stop it! Stop it! Suddenly you're two years old.
RICHARD: Oh, I'm just having fun.
EMILY: I'm not complaining.
RICHARD: This is fun too. This is like a roller coaster.
EMILY: A little.
RICHARD: Say, when was the last time we were on a roller coaster?
EMILY: Never.
RICHARD: Didn't we ever go to Coney Island?
EMILY: That must've been your other wife.
RICHARD: Gosh, I used to love it when I was a kid. They were a lot faster then too.
EMILY: And less safe.
RICHARD: We should go on one.
EMILY: What?
RICHARD: A fast one.
EMILY: Fine. You go and I'll wait and hold your cotton candy for you.
RICHARD: You are going.
EMILY: It would take a whole day.
RICHARD: You are going.
EMILY: I'd be scared.
RICHARD: I'll hold your hand.
EMILY: Fine. We'll go on a roller coaster.
RICHARD: Good.
EMILY: Now where is this roller coaster we're going on?
RICHARD: I'm not sure. I'll get Rory to look it up on the Internet for us.
[cut to Rory getting in a sleigh]
DRIVER: That it miss?
RORY: I guess I'm alone.
[The sleigh starts going. Jess jumps into the seat next to Rory]
RORY: What are you doing?
JESS: Well, I heard it was two to a sleigh - no more, no less. You were breaking the rules.
RORY: You could've hurt yourself.
JESS: I live on the edge. I can jump out if you want.
RORY: Doesn't matter to me.
JESS: Are you mad at me or something?
RORY: What do you think?
JESS: I can't read your mind.
RORY: You got into a fight with Dean.
JESS: Dean?
RORY: My boyfriend.
JESS: Ah. He's still your boyfriend?
RORY: Okay, you can jump out now.
JESS: I wasn't fighting him. I was fighting someone else. He jumped in on his own.
RORY: He was trying to help you.
JESS: Oh, he should go into government service if he's so interested in helping people. But me, he can stop worrying about.
RORY: Why were you fighting in the first place?
JESS: 'Cause Chuck Presby's a jerk.
RORY: You were fighting Chuck Presby?
JESS: Yeah.
RORY: Oh, he is a jerk.
JESS: This whole town is weird and full of jerks.
RORY: Then why are you still here?
JESS: What do you mean?
RORY: I mean, school's out and you don't like it here, so why don't you just go home?
JESS: My mom didn't want me to.
RORY: I don't believe that.
JESS: That's your right, I guess.
RORY: Did Luke say she didn't want you to?
JESS: Luke told me it was his idea that I should stay. It wasn't his idea. That's good.
RORY: What?
JESS: Your snowman. Snowwoman, actually.
RORY: You know which one is ours?
JESS: It definitely has the most personality. Kind of looks like Bjork.
RORY: That's what we were going for.
JESS: Yeah?
RORY: But everyone thinks the one on the end is gonna be the winner.
JESS: Really? It's so overdone.
RORY: I agree.
JESS: You should win.
RORY: No argument.
JESS: Hey, what do you and Dean talk about?
RORY: What?
JESS: I mean, does he know Bjork?
RORY: I've played him some stuff.
JESS: Hm. So you got a teacher-student thing going?
RORY: Stop.
JESS: No, really, I'm curious. What do you guys talk about?
RORY: Everything.
JESS: Like?
RORY: Just everything, tons of stuff, whatever.
JESS: It's just in the brief non-pugilistic time I've spent with him in class, he just doesn't seem like your kind of guy.
RORY: Well, he is my kind of guy. He's exactly my kind of guy.
JESS: Okay. I guess I don't know him that well.
RORY: You don't. You don't.
CUT TO INN DINING ROOM
[All of the guests are seated at a long table. Lorelai stands at the head of the table with a camera.]
LORELAI: Quiet please, everybody. Before the, uh, button popping and the bloating can commence, say cheese.
EVERYONE: Cheese!
LORELAI: Uh, now, ladies and gentlemen, damen und herren, um, the moment you've been waiting for, I give you the Bracebridge Dinner.
SOOKIE: Whoa, whoa, hold it. We just need a quick minute, please.
LORELAI: Which will be starting in one quick minute.
BOOTSY: You ever think about that? You can't have a quick minute because it's always sixty seconds.
LUKE: Shut up.
MISS PATTY: Lorelai darling, who is the silver fox with the tight kneesocks?
LORELAI: Oh, that's Claude. He's one of our regular servers, divorced and on the market.
MISS PATTY: Oh, well the uniform is interesting.
LORELAI: All right. I'll have him bathed, powdered, and sent to your room.
MISS PATTY: What? Oh, you joke? Was that a joke?
RICHARD: Lorelai, this is just beautiful. It's like something out of Architectural Digest. You should be very proud.
LORELAI: Thanks Dad.
EMILY: Your dress needs pressing.
LORELAI: Thanks Mom.
[Lorelai sits down next to Rory]
LORELAI: Your pod Grandpa is still happy as a clam.
RORY: See, I told you this would be good for him.
LORELAI: When you're right, you're right.
RUNE: Welcome Lords and Ladies. I call upon these sprightly horns to commence our proceedings. [horns play] Hey Chuck Mangione, you wanna back up a step?
LORELAI: And we're off.
RUNE: And now, fair people, I present my Lord and Master, the honorable Squire Bracebridge.
[Jackson enters the room dressed as the Squire]
JACKSON: Lo! Now has come our joyfullest feast. Let every man be jolly.
JESS: We should've eaten before we came.
LUKE: Shh! And yeah.
JACKSON: Humble servant, bring us the first course to dine with pleasure. Mmm, methinks it be a butternut squash soup.
RUNE: Ah, methinks you're right Squire Bracebridge, thus and verily.
JACKSON: And verily thus.
LORELAI: They're the Old England Abbot and Costello.
JACKSON: 'Tis perfection, but extremely hot.
RUNE: My Lord, do you need aid? Wouldst thou have thee ice thy tongue?
JACKSON: Ah nay, Rune, nay. To the guests thou shall serve the soup!
JESS: What's the white stuff?
LUKE: I think it's cheese - or cream.
JESS: And the green stuff?
LUKE: I think it'sbest picked off.
MRS. KIM: No one says grace?
LANE: I think they all do Mama, uh, silently.
MRS. KIM: Did you say silent grace?
BABETTE: [laughs] Good one!
[Mrs. Kim stares at her. Babette quickly bows her head and nudges for Morey to do the same. Cut to Kirk serving soup to Lorelai and Rory]
KIRK: Soup for mi'ladies?
RORY: Why thank you, kind sir.
LORELAI: Hey Kirk, nice blouse.
RORY: Don't let her make fun of you Kirk. You look great.
KIRK: Soup with garlands, gay and rosemary.
LORELAI: You're gonna stay in character no matter what, huh?
KIRK: 'Tis hot, so proceed daintily.
LORELAI: Hey, did you ever see that I Love Lucy where she goes to Buckingham Palace?
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: She tries to get the palace guard to break character. That was a funny one.
KIRK: 'Tis foreign to me good lady.
RORY: Hang in there, Kirk.
LORELAI: Those ones where she was in Europe, hands down, those were the best!
KIRK: No way, the Hollywood ones!
LORELAI: Ha!
KIRK: Damn!
RORY: I was rooting for you boy.
[Cut to later that evening]
RUNE: My Lord, shall dessert be served?
JACKSON: Anon, humble servant.
CLARA: Can I eat my dessert with the horses?
DEAN: Sure, uh, but put your coat on.
CLARA: Are you okay?
BOOTSY: I guess so. I've lost track of how many beers I've had.
CLARA: Seven.
LORELAI: Hey Paris, how's it going?
PARIS: Fine, good, thanks for having me.
LORELAI: Oh, it was our pleasure.
PARIS: Did you notice the anachronisms?
LORELAI: The what?
PARIS: The period discrepancies. They were pretty blatant. I mean, forget that the nineteenth century didn't include recessed lighting or the Fossil watch that your server was wearing, but water in that period would not have been served with cubed ice.
LORELAI: Right.
PARIS: And your servers are wearing nylon blend shirts, and nylon was invented by a scientist at Dupont in the 1920's. It shattered the illusion.
LORELAI: Floggings will be administered.
RICHARD: So there we are, it's a beautiful moonlit Prague night, and we're strolling across the Charles Bridge when we come across this group of kids blasting this song by that. . .oh, that awful woman. Who is she? The tall bony one, married to the deceased mustachioed congressman.
RORY: Cher?
EMILY: That's the one!
LORELAI: The year of 'Do you believe in life after love?'
RORY: A difficult time for all of us.
MICHEL: I like that song.
RICHARD: Well, I was appalled. Prague has played host to some of the greatest composers in history. Mozart named a symphony after it, for heaven's sake. So what did I do?
EMILY: I have tried so hard to forget this.
RICHARD: I stood beside them and their boombox and I hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony as loud as I could. [starts humming]
LORELAI: A bizarro Battle of the Bands.
TAYLOR: And did it work?
RICHARD: Well, they quickly packed up and went their way.
EMILY: But then he kept on humming the Mozart. He wouldn't stop.
RICHARD: Well, at that point I was hoping for some gullible tourists to drop money at my feet.
EMILY: And two of them did.
RICHARD: And I kept it!
TAYLOR: You know, this might be the most interesting conversation I've ever had with an insurance man.
RICHARD: Aww, I'm hurt.
TAYLOR: I'm sorry Richard. What I meant was that
RICHARD: No, what you meant was that people in the insurance industry are drones. Well I agree. They are a dull, dull lot, and I am glad to be rid of them.
LORELAI: Rid of them?
TAYLOR: Oh, are you retired Richard?
RICHARD: Well, uh
EMILY: Of course he's not. Richard? Richard?
RICHARD: Actually, I am.
CUT TO BEDROOM
[Later that evening, Lorelai and Rory are in their room at the inn getting ready for bed.]
LORELAI: Ah, it's always nice to end a big festive meal with a big festive pall hanging over the room.
RORY: Most people didn't notice anything.
LORELAI: I guess. Bootsy singing Hotel California accompanied by spoons drew people's attention away.
RORY: Did Grandma and Grandpa say a word to each other the rest of the night?
LORELAI: No.
RORY: Why didn't he tell anyone?
LORELAI: I'm sorry, are you asking me to interpret my parents' motives?
RORY: My mistake. So which bed do you want?
LORELAI: Take the one by the window.
RORY: Okay. [pulls back blanket] Mom!
LORELAI: What honey?
RORY: You put the picture of the ugly baby in my bed?
LORELAI: I didn't, I swear. That ugly baby is stalking us. Run away!
RORY: Poor baby, it's not his fault.
LORELAI: I think it's a she.
RORY: Poor baby, you picked the wrong parents. Hey, have you heard from Dad recently?
LORELAI: What dad - your dad?
RORY: Yeah, my dad.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Because he's my dad, and he usually checks in this time of year and he hasn't checked in yet. I mean, I know he's probably busy with Sherry and the new apartment and...what?
LORELAI: There may have been a call.
RORY: There may have been? You don't remember?
LORELAI: Well things have been so hectic, you know, with the Bracebridge Dinner, and um, building a snowwoman, and planning the ugly baby gag, that took time.
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: Yes, he called! He called, he called, he called and invited you, and it's not too late to go. He called and invited you, so there you go. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, so there.
RORY: He invited me over?
LORELAI: Yes, are you deaf?
RORY: No, I'm just trying to separate the gist from the ubububububah.
LORELAI: Well, the gist is he invited you, okay?
RORY: Why didn't he invite me himself?
LORELAI: Because he's pretending to be considerate by running it past me first.
RORY: Was he maybe not pretending to be considerate, and actually being considerate?
LORELAI: Maybe. But I wouldn't put it past him to be inconsiderate. The guy doesn't have the greatest track record.
RORY: Why didn't you tell me this? He's probably waiting for my answer, and holding off making plans.
LORELAI: Because I have dibs on this time of year with you, not him! Me! And yes, he acknowledged that, and that was cool and all, but still - it stinks! Because he put me in a very difficult position because we were supposed to watch a lot of movies and make fun of Godfather 3, and the thing that I really, really hate about this isis the idea of you not hanging out with me because you're hanging out there with your stupid stepmother.
RORY: You're calling Sherry my stepmother?
LORELAI: Well, she practically is.
RORY: You're wigging.
LORELAI: There is something wrong with that woman.
RORY: You don't even know her.
LORELAI: You think I'm overreacting?
RORY: I think you're jealous of Sherry.
LORELAI: Ha, I'm not jealous of Sherry.
RORY: But I understand - your territory has been threatened.
LORELAI: Excuse me?
RORY: But relax, there are ways to work through situations like this - compromises can be struck.
LORELAI: Oh, what are you saying?
RORY: Well, you know, I can still call you Mom, and I'll call her Mommy Sherry.
LORELAI: Don't be mean.
RORY: And we can split up holidays evenly. Like, I'll be with you on Labor Day
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: her on Memorial Day.
LORELAI: Enough.
RORY: I'll have to find out about her religion though to see how Chanukah will factor into this, unless you want to convert to Judaism and then take over Chanukah for yourself.
LORELAI: I get the point. I overreacted. Please stop.
RORY: You totally overreacted. God.
LORELAI: So do you think you're gonna go and stay with them?
RORY: I'll have to think about it.
LORELAI: Do you have to think about it because you know that it's killing me not to know whether you're going or not and you want to torture me like that?
RORY: Nope, I just don't know if I want to do it.
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: It was nice of him to ask though.
LORELAI: It was very nice.
RORY: 'Cause we are rooting for Dad.
LORELAI: We are rooting for him. It was a very nice thing that Christopher offered. I was being a little possessive.
RORY: And insanely jealous of his pretty girlfriend.
LORELAI: Well, I wanna know if she's good enough for him.
RORY: Me too.
LORELAI: So there was an altruistic streak to my madness.
RORY: We'll go with that.
[there's a knock at the door. Lorelai answers, Emily is there.]
EMILY: I need a new room.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: I can't stay in that room.
LORELAI: There are no other rooms, Mom.
EMILY: Well, then I'll go home.
RORY: Grandma, it's late.
LORELAI: And pitch black, and the roads are icy. You can't be driving.
EMILY: Well, I'm not going back to that room.
LORELAI: I'm guessing you and Dad had it out about the job thing?
EMILY: We haven't even spoken since dinner. I'm so upset, I wouldn't know where to begin. And I couldn't take being around him anymore. What he did is inexcusable. Not letting me know he left his job - as if it didn't affect me?
LORELAI: Aw mom, try to calm down. Here, take this bed, and Rory and I will share.
EMILY: I'm just a burden.
LORELAI: You're not a burden, Mom.
EMILY: Well, okay, thank you. Can I use the mirror in the bathroom for a second?
LORELAI: Yes, I'll use the one out here.
[Rory watches as Lorelai and Emily both apply cream to their face]
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Behold my future.
EMILY: How do you turn out the light?
LORELAI: I'll get it.
EMILY: I still can't believe it.
LORELAI: Try to relax Mom.
EMILY: I hope he doesn't sleep because I surely won't.
LORELAI: Oh, Mom.
EMILY: These slippers you have here are hardly one size fits all. They're too big.
LORELAI: Goodnight.
EMILY: It was so irresponsible.
LORELAI: Maybe he had no choice.
EMILY: Of course he had a choice. Go to sleep Lorelai.
LORELAI: That job was killing him, Mom. It was killing him.
EMILY: I'm going for a little walk.
RORY: Grandma, it's late.
EMILY: I'm not tired.
LORELAI: Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Gilmores of our lives.
CUT TO LOBBY
[Emily walks in and finds Richard sitting on the sofa]
EMILY: I didn't know you were here.
RICHARD: Emily, don't go.
EMILY: I'm very tired.
RICHARD: I want to talk to you, please. I don't need to remind you about how I've been feeling at work, and my frustration just built to the point whereagain, you know this. So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time with my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest. I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me, and I realized it was because I was smiling. Well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time. I was. . .I was happy.
EMILY: And you chose not to tell me? Your own wife.
RICHARD: Oh Emily, I know I've done nothing but disappoint you these past few months, what with how isolated I've become and all the social engagements I've made you cancel, and all the friendships I've jeopardized. And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options. Not a terribly significant amount, but an amount all the same.
EMILY: Richard, let's just go to bed.
CUT TO LOBBY
[The next morning, the guests are leaving]
RORY: See ya Bootsy.
BOOTSY: See ya, thanks. By the way, last night did I sing Hotel California?
RORY: From beginning to end.
LORELAI: While banging spoons on your head.
BOOTSY: Well that explains the lumps.
LORELAI: Bye.
MISS PATTY: Lorelai, darling, oh thank you for everything.
LORELAI: Patty, your timing is excellent. There's Claude over there. Want me to do some matchmaking?
MISS PATTY: Aww, he's wearing a golf shirt and cotton Dockers.
LORELAI: So it was the uniform, huh?
MISS PATTY: Aw, it's the Biloxi Naval Base all over again.
LORELAI: See ya.
MISS PATTY: Bye.
LORELAI: Hey Mom. You didn't make it back to the room last night. Did you get lucky?
EMILY: Could you be any cruder?
LORELAI: Yeah, I can be cruder. Hey mom, did you get la
RORY: Thanks for coming! It was fun. Is everything okay?
RICHARD: Everything's okay.
EMILY: We'll see you next Friday.
LORELAI: Bye. Bye Dad.
RICHARD: Bye Lorelai.
SOOKIE: You just had one grub too many. Just drink lots of water to rehydrate.
JACKSON: I will.
LORELAI: Jackson, thank you for being our Squire.
JACKSON: Oh, you're welcome. Hey, uh, by the way, last night when Bootsy was singing Hotel California and banging spoons on his head, did I
LORELAI: Lift up your shirt and play drums on your stomach? Yes you did.
JACKSON: Oh boy.
RORY: You kept a good beat.
SOOKIE: Yeah, 'cause God knows if the beat was off, you'd have embarrassed yourself.
CLARA: Thanks Rory.
RORY: Clara, I'm glad you came.
DEAN: So I'll see you later.
CLARA: Don't kiss.
DEAN: Aw, come on.
CLARA: Don't kiss.
[Dean covers Clara's eyes while he kisses Rory]
CLARA: Come on.
DEAN: So I guess we're off.
RORY: I guess so.
[Dean walks away, then glances back and sees Rory and Jess smiling at each other]
LORELAI: Bye you guys. Ugh, let's go home.
RORY: Are we coming to get our bags later?
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Because we're walking home. I don't want to carry 'em.
LORELAI: Who says we're walking?
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai and Rory ride home in a horse-drawn sleigh.]
LORELAI: This is the only way to ride.
RORY: I wholeheartedly agree.
[Lorelai sees that the elaborate overdone snowman has been smashed]
LORELAI: Whoa, what happened there?
RORY: I have no idea.
LORELAI: Bad news for ringer guy. But guess who wins by default?
RORY: I guess that would be us.
THE END
F.D. » Transcripts » G » Gilmore Girls2.12 - Richard in Stars Hollow
written by Frank Lombardi
OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai and Rory have just arrived]
LORELAI: Thanks. Man, is it cold out there.
RORY: I know, I'm freezing.
EMILY: Well, come on in and sit by the fire. I'll make you both a drink and then we can talk.
RORY: About what?
LORELAI: Antennas up.
RORY: Aye aye, captain.
[they walk to the living room]
EMILY: So Lorelai, how are you?
LORELAI: Um, I'm fine Mom.
EMILY: Rory?
RORY: I'm fine too, Grandma.
LORELAI: How are you Mom?
EMILY: Also fine.
LORELAI: Oh, look at that. All three of us fine, just like the Judds.
EMILY: So Lorelai, are you dating?
LORELAI: Uh, hm, no, I'm not dating.
EMILY: Really? There's no one at all?
LORELAI: No, totally single.
EMILY: Any chance you'd get back with Max?
LORELAI: No Mom, there's no chance.
EMILY: What about the man at the diner, the one who refuses to shave?
LORELAI: Luke, he's just a friend Mom.
EMILY: Do you think you'll be single your entire life?
LORELAI: Excuse me?
EMILY: I mean, in terms of your finding someone, what do you think the odds are?
LORELAI: Okay, what is going on?
EMILY: Well, I visited the family mausoleum today.
LORELAI: Never what you think it's gonna be!
EMILY: I just wanted to check on things, make sure they were keeping it up, changing the flowers, you know.
LORELAI: Uh huh.
EMILY: So I went inside and looked around and it occurred to me that there's a very limited space there.
LORELAI: Oh.
EMILY: Now of course there's a slot open for me and Richard and you and Rory, but after the two of you that's it. No more room for anyone else.
LORELAI: Ah.
EMILY: Yes. So if you actually do meet someone someday, I don't know where to put him.
LORELAI: Well, maybe we could just dump him at the local pool hall.
EMILY: Don't be silly.
LORELAI: No, because this is definitely not a conversation for that.
EMILY: I looked into expanding into the crypt next door but the family that owns it wouldn't even discuss it with me.
RORY: I'm getting a little creeped out here.
EMILY: So I talked to the head of the cemetery and he suggested that we buy an annex.
RORY: An annex?
EMILY: Yes.
LORELAI: You know, like an outlet store, it would specialize in the irregular family members.
EMILY: So if we do get the annex and you do eventually someday get married
LORELAI: Mom, just say it fat chance will you?
EMILY: I just meant that we'll have to decide who to move.
LORELAI: Oh, oh. Well, uh. . .ugh, why don't we move Aunt Cecile? She was always so annoying at parties. She loved the knock-knock jokes.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: You can't just kick out Aunt Cecile.
LORELAI: Knock-knock. Who's there? Pineapple. Pineapple who? That's where it ended. Never fully grasped the knock-knock concept.
EMILY: She was a complete idiot. Okay, it's decided Cecile goes.
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: Look - put me in the annex.
LORELAI: Unh uh. No way. You are not leaving me alone in there with Cecile.
RORY: Well I'm not gonna be held responsible for somebody being kicked out of their eternal resting place.
LORELAI: Ooh, I have an idea. I'll probably go first, right? So when Rory kicks, just throw her in with me.
RORY: I'd like my own space if you don't mind.
LORELAI: Why? It'd totally be fun to be there together. Plus I plan to be buried with all the good CD's and my rock star belt.
[Richard comes down the steps]
RICHARD: Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?
EMILY: We were just discussing who to move to the annex.
RICHARD: Oh. I vote for Cecile. Horrible woman, and those terrible jokes.
LORELAI: What'd I tell you?
RORY: This is a cold, cold family.

[Later that night, Lorelai, Rory, Richard, and Emily are at the table eating dinner.]
LORELAI: This is really good.
RORY: Yeah, what is it?
EMILY: Well, it -.
LORELAI: No, don't tell us.
RORY: Why not?
LORELAI: Because every time in my life that I've tasted something great but I didn't know what it was, it turned out to be something really disgusting that had I known what I was eating I never would've tried it in the first place.
RORY: Example?
LORELAI: Snails.
RORY: Gross.
LORELAI: Eat in ignorance and enjoy it, my friend.
RORY: Gladly.
LORELAI: So Dad, how's the retired life treating you?
RICHARD: Well, fascinating actually. I find myself noticing things, everyday things that I must've witnessed a hundred times before but just walked right past. Like yesterday, your mother moved a vase, the one in the hall, and she didn't do it in front of me.
LORELAI: Oh no, cause nice girls never move vases in front of men.
RICHARD: And she only moved it a little but as I passed it by I noticed it had been moved.
RORY: Impressive.
RICHARD: And every day's a new discovery. Your mother changed her hair. Or she wore shoes that didn't match her purse.
EMILY: Richard.
RICHARD: Last Thursday.
EMILY: Oh, for heaven's sake.
RICHARD: You know what else I noticed?
RORY: What?
RICHARD: A first edition Flaubert, mint condition, shoved behind several of my Churchill biographies.
RORY: No!
RICHARD: Interested?
RORY: My life is good.
RICHARD: Follow me.
LORELAI: Ooh Dad, see if you can find a pair of the new Chanel patent leather pirate boots stuffed back behind your Churchills.
RICHARD: Hmm.
[Richard and Rory leave the room]
LORELAI: What's up Mom?
EMILY: Nothing's up.
LORELAI: You were twitching. I saw you.
EMILY: You did not see me twitching.
LORELAI: Mom, when Dad was talking about the vase, you were pulling a full-on Tabitha.
EMILY: I did not pull a Tabitha.
LORELAI: Something wrong?
EMILY: No, nothing's wrong.
LORELAI: Hm, okay, nothing's wrong.
EMILY: It's just that things are a little strange lately.
LORELAI: What is?
EMILY: Having him home.
LORELAI: Ah.
EMILY: We've never really been home at the same time. I mean, we got married, we went to Europe, we came back, he went to work, and it's been that way ever since.
LORELAI: Well, so now it's different.
EMILY: It's very different. He's always here watching me and noticing when I move a vase and. . .I don't know. It's silly. So he noticed my hair was different. Women die for that sort of thing.
LORELAI: Aw Mom, it's just an adjustment. You've had your routine, he's had his routine. You guys just need to figure out a new routine.
EMILY: I guess so.
LORELAI: Yeah, it'll just take some time. Then you'll find your rhythm and he'll go back to ignoring your hair, all will be well.
EMILY: Yes, you're probably right.
LORELAI: Mm, I am right. Okay, I give. What is this?
EMILY: Sweetbreads.
LORELAI: Sweetbreads. So that's uh. . .
EMILY: Pancreas.
CUT TO CHILTON
[At a meeting of the Franklin, Paris is going through a stack of stories that people have submitted.]
PARIS: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: I'm not done.
RORY: Sorry.
PARIS: No.
LOUISE: Glad she finished that one.
PARIS: Why am I the only one who cares?
RORY: You're not the only one who cares.
PARIS: No. I know you care, but I need everyone in this stupid room to care because I can't be the only one to care. Besides you.
LOUISE: It's just a contest Paris. It's not like you get a car or a lifetime supply of Rice a Roni.
MADELINE: God, I love that stuff.
PARIS: The Oppenheimer Award for Excellence in school journalism is not a contest. It's a statement. It says you're the best. The best writers, the best reporters, the best editors. It says that you have crushed all others who have dared to take you on. It says that every other single school in the United States of America is feeling nothing but shame and defeat and pain because of the people who won the Oppenheimer plaque. I wanna be those people, I wanna cause that pain.
RORY: Our paper is good.
PARIS: Not good enough.
RORY: Last week's issue - .
PARIS: Was a fine effort by a bunch of kids.
MADELINE: We are a bunch of kids.
PARIS: Not when we're in this room, we're not. Flescher Prep Gazette, Broadmouth Banner, Richmond Heights Chronicle - these publications are not our competition.
LOUISE: Geez.
PARIS: The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post - these publications are our competition.
MADELINE: Paris has gone bye-bye.
PARIS: We need to raise the bar. We need to be better, think harder, dig deeper. I don't wanna just submit a good issue. I wanna submit a great issue, the best issue.
RORY: When's the deadline?
PARIS: One week from today.
RORY: Okay, so, then we better get brainstorming. Doe anyone have an idea for a theme?
PARIS: Yes.
RORY: What?
PARIS: The one that wins.
RORY: Okay, good, big help. All right everyone, we should get working. You're going to give yourself a stroke one of these days, you know that.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Emily walks through the hall into the living room.]
EMILY: Graciela, I'm leaving the shopping list on the table here. And remember we need the low sudsing detergent. I have drawn a picture of what the box looks like, so for heaven's sake pay attention this time.
[Richard walks in]
EMILY: How was your walk?
RICHARD: Carl Lambertson needs a new roof. I'm going to drop him a note.
EMILY: Good idea.
RICHARD: Busy day?
EMILY: Mm, very.
RICHARD: Is that the same cup of coffee you had when I left?
EMILY: What?
RICHARD: When I left an hour ago, you were having a cup of coffee.
EMILY: Oh, no, this is a different cup of coffee.
RICHARD: So then that's your third cup of coffee this morning?
EMILY: I guess.
RICHARD: Interesting. I just realized you have three cups of coffee in the morning.
EMILY: I don't drink three cups of coffee every morning.
RICHARD: Every morning this week.
EMILY: Well, so what?
RICHARD: Nothing. Just an observation, that's all. That's a lot of coffee to drink early in the morning.
EMILY: Any thoughts on what you'd like for dinner tonight?
RICHARD: Oh no, anything's fine.
EMILY: All right. [writes something down in her day planner]
RICHARD: What are you writing down?
EMILY: Lamb chops.
RICHARD: Is that for tonight?
EMILY: Yes.
RICHARD: Oh.
EMILY: Do you not want lamb chops tonight?
RICHARD: Oh, no no, lamb chops is just fine for tonight. I just thought a nice roast would also be nice for a change.
EMILY: Roast it is.
RICHARD: Of course, if you want lamb chops
EMILY: We're having roast, Richard.
RICHARD: Okay, if that's what you want.
EMILY: I'm going by the dry cleaners, anything you want me to drop off?
RICHARD: You're going to the dry cleaners?
EMILY: Yes.
RICHARD: Well I'll go with you.
EMILY: I can bring in whatever you have.
RICHARD: I know, but it'd be nice to go together.
EMILY: That would be terribly romantic, but I won't have time to get back here before my DAR meeting so it's probably better if I go alone. You can come to the cleaners with me next week.
RICHARD: Well yes, well I can go to the meeting with you.
EMILY: You want to go to my meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution?
RICHARD: Well, well yes, I think it'd be fascinating.
EMILY: But I go straight from there to the symphony luncheon.
RICHARD: Well, I'll tag along there too.
EMILY: Yes, but from there I get my hair done, and you certainly don't want to sit around while I have my hair done.
RICHARD: No, I don't.
EMILY: There you go.
RICHARD: Well, you can cancel that.
EMILY: I can't cancel that. I get my hair done every Wednesday at three.
RICHARD: Well, your hair looks fine.
EMILY: My hair looks fine because I have my hair done every Wednesday at three.
RICHARD: Well then what am I going to do?
EMILY: Why don't you go to the club?
RICHARD: What?
EMILY: Yes, the club! You spend a fortune to belong there and you never got to go much before. Why don't you go there now?
RICHARD: Go to the club on a Wednesday afternoon?
EMILY: I think it would be perfect.
RICHARD: I don't even know what they do at the club on a Wednesday afternoon.
EMILY: No time like the present to find out.
RICHARD: All right, I'll go to the club.
EMILY: Wonderful. [starts walking him to the front door]
RICHARD: Go to the club on a Wednesday afternoon. Life certainly is an interesting game of cards, isn't it?
EMILY: It certainly is.
RICHARD: Well, um, I'll see you, uh, tonight.
EMILY: Have a good time. [closes door] Graciela, I need more coffee now!
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW VIDEO
[Rory and Lorelai walk around the video store trying to decide on a movie]
LORELAI: How about a triple feature? Three Days of the Condor, Shoah and The Jerk?
RORY: Uh, Shoah's like nine and a half hours.
LORELAI: But The Jerk is short.
RORY: Hmm, next.
LORELAI: The three faces of Costner Bull Durham, Dances with Wolves, The Postman. Tom Petty playing Tom Petty, that great big speech about Once upon a time there was a thing called mail.' It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll make you wanna mail something.
RORY: Ooh, we could do a Ruth Gordon film festival. Harold and Maude, Rosemary's Baby, and that really great episode of Taxi.
LORELAI: Got it. The worst film festival ever. Cool as Ice, Hudson Hawk, and Electric Bugaloo.
RORY: Sold.
LORELAI: I'll get the Hawk.
RORY: I'll get the Bugaloo.
[Rory leans down to look through the shelf of videos. Two boys are sitting on the floor looking at a movie box.]
BOY 1: See, I told you.
BOY 2: Wow.
RORY: Hey guys, can I get in there?
BOY 1: Oh, yeah. [both boys walk away]
[Rory finds the movie and stands back up]
LORELAI: Got it, plus four boxes of Red Vines.
RORY: Let's go.
LORELAI: Hi Kirk.
KIRK: Evening Lorelai.
LORELAI: Um, I forgot my card at home but I think my number's 6247.
KIRK: You forgot your card?
LORELAI: I might've lost it.
KIRK: You lost your card?
LORELAI: I might have.
KIRK: Was it temporary or laminated?
LORELAI: Laminated.
KIRK: That's a permanent card. You lost a permanent card.
LORELAI: You can just get me a new card Kirk.
KIRK: Fine, but I hope you understand the gravity of the situation here.
LORELAI: I'm trying to grasp it.
KIRK: I mean, these cards are agreements. It's an agreement between you and the Stars Hollow Video Store stating that you will take care of your card, that you will honor your card, that you will very, very nice to your card...
[Lorelai's cell phone is ringing]
LORELAI: Kirk.
KIRK: I'll be right back.
LORELAI: Thanks. [answers phone] Hello? Hello? [to Rory] Reception sucks in here, I'll be right back.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Hello? [walks away]
KIRK: It'll be ready in a minute.
RORY: Hey Kirk, there are a couple of little kids over there and they're, uh, looking at this tape cover that's kind of mature. You might wanna put that stuff on a higher shelf or something.
KIRK: Mature? How mature?
RORY: Uh, it's a half-naked woman just standing there.
KIRK: Is she a blonde?
RORY: What?
KIRK: I'll check it out right now. [walks away]
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai walks out of the video store to talk on the phone]
LORELAI: Hey Mom, I can hear you now. What's up?
EMILY: You have to take your father.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Tomorrow, for the whole day, just take him.
LORELAI: Take him where?
EMILY: I don't care -- the zoo, the mall, Rhode Island, just get him out of my house!
LORELAI: What happened?
EMILY: He's going to join my water aerobics class.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: He bought some new swim trunks today. He's out of control.
LORELAI: Okay, Mom, calm down.
EMILY: I can't calm down! I can't turn around without him being there, following me, staring at me.
LORELAI: Well, he likes you.
EMILY: Don't be cute, do not be cute. The man is driving me insane. I am going to go insane, and if you don't help me, I will take you with me.
LORELAI: Okay, Mom, I would like to help you but wh --.
EMILY: You owe me!
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: I pay for Rory's school!
LORELAI: Are you serious?
EMILY: And I cosigned your loan! You still have a house because of me!
LORELAI: Are you hearing yourself?
EMILY: I'm sorry but I'm desperate. I just need one day of peace and I will do anything to get it, anything.
LORELAI: Okay Mom, fine, uh, I'll take him.
EMILY: I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.
RICHARD: [calls from another room] Emily! Where are you?
EMILY: I have to go. Tomorrow morning.
LORELAI: Tomorrow morning. Bye.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory is in her bedroom getting ready for school as Lorelai walks in.]
LORELAI: Oh my God, the most horrible thing just happened. Headmaster Charleston's office called, he's been kidnapped! Two guys broke into his house and threw him in a hefty bag, used those twisty ties and carted him off. Classes have been canceled until further notice.
RORY: I am going to school Mom.
LORELAI: Rory, come on, it's just one day. I'll write you a note. Dear Nazis, Rory had to miss school today on account of saving her mom from spending the entire day with her father who often looks at her like she has three heads.'
RORY: Out of my way please.
LORELAI: Do you know the last time my father and I were alone together for any extended period of time?
RORY: Unh uh.
LORELAI: I was kicked out of summer class for refusing to call the camp counselor Peaches because I thought the entire concept of the counselors choosing summer fruit names was stupid. So they called my dad and he came to get me and it was just the two of us alone in the car all the way from Maine with nothing to talk about but my camp failure. Luckily I had also flashed the swim team or even that subject would've gotten stale.
RORY: Mom, I have the Franklin today. I cannot miss it.
LORELAI: Rory, please. I can't handle the entire day with him. I can't, I can't, I caaaaan't.
RORY: Mom, I promise. Just make it till the afternoon, and then I promise I'll come right home and I'll take Grandpa off your hands.
LORELAI: All right.
RORY: It'll be fine.
LORELAI: It is not going to be fine. It's going to be horrible. It is going to be a bad, depressing Lifetime movie and Nancy McKeon will be playing me. I am Jo.
[the doorbell rings]
LORELAI: And that would be him.
RORY: It's not going to be that bad. Hey. Be nice.
LORELAI: Be nice.
RORY: Oh, very good.
[they answer the front door, Richard is standing there]
LORELAI: Hi Dad.
RORY: Hey Grandpa.
RICHARD: Good morning girls.
LORELAI: Did you have any trouble getting here?
RICHARD: Not at all, the directions were fine.
RORY: Well I have to be going, but I'll see you this afternoon.
RICHARD: I look forward to it.
RORY: Have fun. [leaves]
LORELAI: So good drive, huh?
RICHARD: Very good.
LORELAI: Oh, here. [takes Richard's coat] Would you like some coffee?
RICHARD: I'm fine. Do you want coffee?
LORELAI: Oh yes, God yes, thank you.
[They walk into the kitchen]
LORELAI: So you sure you don't, um. . .
RICHARD: Coffee? Uh, no, no, no, no.
LORELAI: Well, uh, can I offer you anything else? Some Pop Tarts or. . .well, that's pretty much it.
RICHARD: You don't have to entertain me Lorelai. I just came here to see you and your house and your town. You don't have to do anything special for me.
LORELAI: But you're my guest.
RICHARD: No, I'm your father. Just do whatever it is you would normally do.
LORELAI: What I would normally do.
RICHARD: Yes. Like for instance, this morning if I wasn't here, you would wake up, obviously get some coffee and. . .then what?
LORELAI: Well, um, I'd probably read the paper for a little while and then have some breakfast.
RICHARD: Let's read the paper then.
LORELAI: Okay, let's read the paper. [they sit down at the table] Um, what sections would you like?
RICHARD: Oh, you go first. I'll take what's left.
LORELAI: Oh, okay. Well, um, normally I read the Arts and Leisure and the Lifestyles.
RICHARD: Perfect. Well, that leaves Business, Sports, and World News.
LORELAI: Oh. That worked out well.
RICHARD: Yes it did, didn't it?
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Richard walk in]
LORELAI: Well, this is it, Luke's.
RICHARD: You know, when I was in college, there was this horrible little diner across from my apartment building. It was run by this terrible little couple, they were very angry. They would fight, break plates, curse, and I went in there every morning for three years and I had the most dreadful breakfast, just awful. I really miss that place.
LUKE: Morning.
LORELAI: Hey. Um, Luke, you remember my father?
LUKE: Oh yeah, nice to see you again.
RICHARD: Nice to see you. This is quite a place you've got here.
LUKE: It pays the bills.
RICHARD: Always a plus in business.
LORELAI: Dad, do you know what you want?
RICHARD: Oh, I already ate.
LORELAI: You did? When?
RICHARD: Oh, I had breakfast at home. I get up at 5:30 every morning.
LORELAI: Wow. Why?
RICHARD: Well I've gotten up at 5:30 for as long as I can remember.
LORELAI: Yeah, but that was when you had to work. Now you can afford to get a little crazy, get up at quarter to six.
RICHARD: Go ahead and order Lorelai.
LORELAI: Okay. I'll have a banana, pancakes, side of bacon, and lots and lots of coffee.
LUKE: Coming right up. [walks away]
RICHARD: You didn't order any grapefruit.
LORELAI: Yeah, I don't really like grapefruit.
RICHARD: Oh, I always start my breakfast off with half a grapefruit.
LORELAI: Hm, do the Florida people know about you? Because Anita Bryant left this huge gap that has yet to be filled.
RICHARD: It's important to start the day off correctly, Lorelai. A grapefruit is brain food. It has vitamin C and folic acid and it helps with your digestion. It really is a terrific fruit.
LORELAI: I feel like you're about to break into song.
RICHARD: I'm serious about this Lorelai.
LORELAI: I know you are but I still don't like grapefruit.
RICHARD: Well, there are many things in life that we don't like, but the benefits they bring us far outweigh the temporary discomforts we have to endure.
LORELAI: Okay. Hold on a sec.
[Lorelai walks up to Luke at the counter]
LORELAI: Hey, I need a grapefruit.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Yeah. Before my pancakes this morning I need half a grapefruit, uh, preferably one that tastes like a donut.
LUKE: I don't have grapefruit.
LORELAI: How can you not have grapefruit?
LUKE: I've never had grapefruit.
LORELAI: I need a grapefr. . .Listen, I have my father with me all day, and so far there's been no major drama or yelling or ugliness but there will be if I don't somehow find a way to get half a grapefruit for breakfast this morning.
LUKE: I could go next door to Doose's and buy a grapefruit.
LORELAI: I would be eternally grateful.
LUKE: I'll be right back.
LORELAI: Thank you.
[Lorelai walks back to the table]
LORELAI: Okay, the grapefruit is coming.
RICHARD: Oh, you won't be sorry.
LORELAI: So listen, I was thinking, um, maybe after we're done here, you might like to walk around town a little, see the sites. And then Rory usually gets home around four. The two of you can hang out at the house until I get off work and the three of us can hook up for dinner. How does that sound?
RICHARD: Very sensible.
LORELAI: Well yeah, I had to make up for my shoes.
RICHARD: Is that your second cup of coffee?
LORELAI: Uh, third. Why?
RICHARD: No reason. That's a lot of coffee first thing in the morning.
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory is at her locker. She slams it shut and finds Paris standing there.]
RORY: Okay, you have got to stop doing that.
PARIS: So I've been doing some research on the Oppenheimer Award, and I've noticed something. All of the winning schools had an extremely strong human interest story on page one.
RORY: Okay.
PARIS: And I think that's what we need. I mean, we've got the teen issues down, we've got a decent op-ed and political page, but human interest that's what we're missing.
RORY: Ideas?
PARIS: Yes.
RORY: Do tell.
PARIS: According to the papers, there's been a huge increase in the number of families fleeing the major cities in favor of small towns. Hundreds of thousands of city slicking yuppies carting the trophy wife and the asthmatic kids off to small towns in search of the simple life. Milk a cow, pet a pig, find yourself, all that kind of crap.
RORY: Interesting.
PARIS: Yeah, and I thought about it. There's a romantic aspect to small towns. White picket fences, low crime rate, smaller classrooms, better tomatoes. It all seems perfect.
RORY: But?
PARIS: But nothing is perfect, nothing is safe, nothing is ever what it seems. And then it hit me - our story. We are going to blow the lid off the seedy underbelly of small town life, starting with yours.
RORY: Stars Hollows?
PARIS: Yes.
RORY: You are going to uncover the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow?
PARIS: Yes.
RORY: Paris, Stars Hollow doesn't have a seedy underbelly. We don't even have a meter maid.
PARIS: Look, you may be blind to it because you live there, but trust me, it's there and it's ugly and I'm going to find it. I'll meet you out front after school.
RORY: I can't today.
PARIS: Why not? Are you hiding something?
RORY: No. I promised my mom that I would help her with something.
PARIS: Well, help her tomorrow. We have work to do.
RORY: Paris!
PARIS: Hey, this could be our chance to nail this thing. Now I have a hunch that there's a story here and a good one, and I'm going to find it. I was even going to share a byline with you on it, but if you wanna bail out, that's fine. I'll just do it myself.
RORY: But -.
PARIS: Am I meeting you or not?
RORY: I don't think you're gonna find anything.
PARIS: Well, then the worst that can happen is that I spend some time in your town and suddenly have an urge to enter a pie in the county fair. I'll meet you out front, don't be late.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Michel is at the front desk on the phone as Lorelai walks over]
MICHEL: As soon as I can, I will send someone up. . . Yes, I will. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . . Okay. . .I understand. Goodbye. [hangs up]
LORELAI: What do you understand?
MICHEL: I have no idea. I tuned him out at the first screech.
LORELAI: Have we heard from Manny yet?
MICHEL: No, and I have paged him twice.
LORELAI: We only have enough linen for one seating tonight. Hand me the phone.
MICHEL: Plus we are completely out of clean towels.
LORELAI: [oh phone] Hi, Sophie, it's Lorelai. I need to talk to Manny. . . Well, when will he be back? . . . Okay, I need him to call me really, really soon, like five minutes ago. Okay, thanks. [hangs up] We need a backup plan.
MICHEL: Mm hmm.
LORELAI: Call Patty's and see if she has any party rental tablecloths we can use for tonight and then pull all the towels from the pool and call Gandolfi's and order a case of champagne. Send a bottle to every room that's towel-less and just page him every two minutes and oh no! [sees Richard walk into the inn]
RICHARD: Hi.
LORELAI: Hi Dad, what are you doing? Uh, I thought you were gonna tour the town.
RICHARD: Oh, I did, I did. I went into all the stores, the cat one twice. And then I walked around a little and then I was done.
LORELAI: But what about the park did you see the park?
RICHARD: Yes, I saw the park.
LORELAI: Uh, what about the giant slinky over on Klump? We're mighty proud of that.
RICHARD: I saw the slinky, yes. And the hundred-year-old oak tree and the life-size yarn person. I even stopped by your house and had Babette introduce me to all of her gnomes.
LORELAI: Oh.
RICHARD: And then I realized the only thing I had not seen is my daughter at work.
LORELAI: Oh, well, watching me at work is not very interesting, trust me.
RICHARD: Oh, you underestimate yourself.
LORELAI: Okay, well, um, there's books on the shelves over there.
RICHARD: No no, I have my newspaper, I'm fine.
LORELAI: All right, I'm just gonna. . . what's the matter?
RICHARD: Is your jacket in the back?
LORELAI: My jacket?
RICHARD: Your work jacket?
LORELAI: I don't have a work jacket.
RICHARD: So that's your working outfit?
LORELAI: Yeah.
RICHARD: And your boss doesn't mind?
LORELAI: Oh, well considering my boss is me, no, she doesn't. I mean, she did at first but then I bought her a cup of coffee and I realized all the hostility she was expressing toward me was just jealousy and we've been best friends ever since. Just take a seat Dad. [walks to the front desk] Hey, will you get me an extra bottle of champagne and smack me over the head with it?
MICHEL: Absolutely.
[phone rings]
LORELAI: [answers] Independence Inn.
RORY: I need you to sit down, breathe, and remember that you're at work, so screaming and crying is not an option.
LORELAI: Why, what are you doing?
RORY: I can't meet you after school today.
LORELAI: What? You promised.
RORY: I know but I have to work on this story for the Franklin and I swear I tried to get out of it, but I couldn't.
LORELAI: Oh great.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: Oh no, school comes before Mommy's mental health.
RORY: Just tell Grandpa to wander around for awhile.
LORELAI: He already wandered.
RORY: Did he see the slinky?
LORELAI: Yes, he saw the slinky.
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: He's here now.
RORY: Oh.
LORELAI: And he hates my shirt.
RORY: Give him a book and have Sookie make him lunch and I swear I'll be home by dinner and you won't have to say a word.
LORELAI: Okay, bye.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW BUS STOP
[Rory and Paris get off of the bus]
PARIS: I think I got rabies.
RORY: It's just a bus, Paris.
PARIS: It smelled.
RORY: It smelled like a bus.
PARIS: I'm gonna have to burn my clothes when I get home.
RORY: You know Paris, you have a car. We could've driven.
PARIS: We have to get the feel of the small town world. You're not going to get the feel of a small town world in a BMW. Is there something crawling in my hair?
RORY: All right, so we're here now, where do you wanna go?
PARIS: I don't know, where's the bad part of town?
RORY: Uhh, over there.
PARIS: What?
RORY: Uh, people - they're very upset with the color of that fence.
PARIS: Come on.
RORY: This is the town Paris, this is it. It's not seedy, it's not rundown, it's just Stars Hollow.
PARIS: Well, where's the local bar?
RORY: In Woodbridge.
PARIS: Why aren't you helping?
RORY: I'm trying, you're just looking for something that's not here.
PARIS: What's this?
RORY: Luke's Diner.
PARIS: Diner. Okay, good, good.
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S
[Paris and Rory walk in and sit at the counter. Paris starts looking at a menu.]
RORY: What are you doing?
PARIS: Trying just to blend in, fade away, observe.
LUKE: Hey Rory. Coffee?
RORY: Thanks Luke.
LUKE: Who's your friend?
RORY: Angela Landsbury.
LUKE: Oh.
PARIS: You're the owner here?
LUKE: Yup. You want some coffee Angela?
PARIS: No thanks.
LUKE: Okay.
PARIS: So, you run the diner, huh?
RORY: Oh boy.
PARIS: You get a lot of truckers through here?
LUKE: Truckers?
PARIS: Yeah. You know, guys on the road for weeks, lonely, looking for company, a little pick me up. Things like that.
LUKE: What's she talking about?
RORY: Your guess is as good as mine.
PARIS: It's pretty common knowledge that diners are breeding grounds for prostitution and drug dealers.
LUKE: What?
PARIS: Have you ever seen anything like that going down here?
LUKE: Have I ever. . .
PARIS: What about that guy over there? What's his story?
LUKE: Reverend Nichols?
PARIS: Reverend Nichols, huh? What is that, like Dr. Feelgood?
LUKE: Rory, how much do you like this person?
RORY: Do what you gotta do, Luke.
[Jess comes down the steps into the diner]
PARIS: Hey, where'd he come from? What's up there? Is that where you keep the girls? You got yourself a little cathouse up there?
JESS: Wow, I think she got you Uncle Luke. You better give up now.
LUKE: Do not add to this insanity.
JESS: An innocent boy like me should not be raised in an atmosphere like this.
LUKE: Jess!
JESS: I wanna be good, life's just not letting me.
LUKE: Rory, get her out of here.
RORY: Okay, let's go. [pulls Paris towards the door]
PARIS: Why do you need me to leave? What have you got to hide?
RORY: Paris, let's go!
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Lorelai and Michel are at the front desk, each talking on a phone]
MICHEL: Yes, we're aware of it.
LORELAI: Yes, we're working on it.
MICHEL: As soon as towels arrive, yours will be the first room we come up to.
LORELAI: I swear to you, no one gets a towel before you do.
MICHEL: Did you get the complimentary champagne we sent you?
LORELAI: Just open the champagne and drink and relax and enjoy and before you know it of course it's free. Yes.
MICHEL: Yeah, we'll call you soon. [hangs up]
LORELAI: We'll talk to you soon. [hangs up] I'm killing Manny.
MICHEL: I'm helping.
LORELAI: I'm gonna strangle him with one of his own towels, I swear to God.
RICHARD: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Yeah Dad?
RICHARD: Do you realize there are no tablecloths in the dining room?
LORELAI: Yes I do. We're having a problem with our linen delivery.
RICHARD: Well, it doesn't look very professional.
MICHEL: [in background] Ah, it's Manny.
LORELAI: Okay, I have to take this dad.
[Michel hands her the phone]
LORELAI: Manny, my mysterious man, where have you been? . . . Oh, me Manny? I'm just a desperate woman. Yes. Honey, I know you're up to your ears in problems but I have to have some towels or linens or I'm gonna be lying on the street talking about the pretty inn I used to work at and you don't want that do you? . . . Well, just, anything you can do to get me through the night. . . Uh, Manny, I love you. You rock. I am devoted to you. I'm never gonna look at another towel without thinking of you. . . Thank you. Bye Stud. [hangs up] He'll be here in twenty minutes.
RICHARD: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Yes Dad?
RICHARD: May I speak to you for a moment please?
MICHEL: Someone is in trouble.
LORELAI: Uh, is something wrong Dad?
RICHARD: Was that a business call I just overheard there?
LORELAI: Oh, that was my linen delivery guy.
RICHARD: So it was a business call?
LORELAI: Yes, it was a business call.
RICHARD: And that's how you handle a business call?
LORELAI: I've known Manny for ten years, Dad.
RICHARD: I don't care how long you've known him. You never talk to a business associate like that, especially not one that you employ.
LORELAI: Okay Dad.
RICHARD: These people have to respect you.
LORELAI: He does respect me.
RICHARD: You were flirting with him.
LORELAI: I said what I needed to say in order to get the linen before somebody else did. And I did, so I won.
RICHARD: This is not about winning, this is about proper procedure. You need to listen to me Lorelai. If there is one thing I know about, it is the correct way to conduct yourself in a position of authority. Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
LORELAI: Mm hmm.
RICHARD: Because I'm only telling you this for your own good.
LORELAI: Mm hmm.
RICHARD: All right, go back to work. I'll be right here if you need me.
LORELAI: Okie dokie.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Rory and Paris are walking down the sidewalk]
PARIS: Nothing, not even a cigarette butt on the ground, I can't believe it. This town would make Frank Capra wanna throw up.
RORY: Sorry, I tried to tell you.
PARIS: I know. I know, it's just. . .I was just so sure.
RORY: We'll think of something else to write about, I promise.
PARIS: We're going to lose.
RORY: We're not going to lose.
[As they walk past the video store, Taylor and Kirk walk out.]
TAYLOR: There she is, the girl of the moment.
RORY: Me?
TAYLOR: You, young lady, are my hero.
RORY: Why is that Taylor?
TAYLOR: Because in this day and age when the kids are willy nilly with their clothes and hair and morals, it is heartwarming to see a sensible girl like you still exists. A girl who has the gumption and the guts to stand up and say, why are we allowing this trash out where all our children can see it?'
KIRK: And a few selected adults also.
RORY: What are you talking about?
TAYLOR: Well, come on in and see for yourself.
CUT TO INSIDE VIDEO STORE
RORY: What happened? Where is everything?
TAYLOR: Well, thanks to your brilliant suggestion, they are all safely stashed behind the Rory Curtain.
RORY: The what?
KIRK: We thought it was only fitting to name it after you.
RORY: No! I don't want a Rory Curtain, I never asked for a Rory Curtain!
TAYLOR: You told me to put that movie where the kids couldn't see it.
PARIS: You did?
RORY: Well, yeah, but I just meant to put it on a higher shelf, not to get fabric involved.
TAYLOR: Oh, this is much better than a higher shelf. Now all the movies that we deem objectionable will be safely hidden from the eyes of the children. Plus, it'll make the adults think twice before they go back there.
RORY: No, I did not mean to do this! What are you doing?
PARIS: This is it.
RORY: This is what?
PARIS: Our story. Censorship in a small town, it's perfect.
RORY: Paris, stop it. You know I don't believe in censorship.
PARIS: Even better, small town minds run amok. This is genius, it's gold. We're going to win. Now Taylor?
TAYLOR: Yes?
PARIS: On the record, how long have you been working here?
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai walks through the front door followed by Richard.]
LORELAI: Rory, we're home!
RICHARD: Next time, stop the car completely before you get out.
LORELAI: Rory, for the love of God, be home!
RORY: I'm here, sorry! I was on the phone. How was your [Lorelai grabs Rory and hugs her tightly] Ooh, okay.
LORELAI: I don't think I've ever loved you quite as much as I love you right now.
RORY: Ah, ribs cracking, organs crushing.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, love hurts. [walks past Rory towards the kitchen]
RORY: Hey Grandpa.
RICHARD: Oh, lovely to see you Rory.
RORY: How was your day?
RICHARD: It was very pleasant.
RORY: I heard you saw Mom in action.
LORELAI: Oh yes he did.
RORY: She's great, isn't she?
RICHARD: She's. . uh, spirited.
LORELAI: Spirited.
RORY: Spirited is nice. Hey, let's talk dinner. How about Chinese?
LORELAI: Very spirited food.
RORY: Grandpa, do you like Chinese food?
RICHARD: If prepared properly, yes, I like it very much.
LORELAI: I'll go call Al's. [walks into kitchen]
RICHARD: Al's?
RORY: Al's Pancake World.
RICHARD: [follows Lorelai into the kitchen] I thought you said we were having Chinese food.
LORELAI: Al's has the best egg fu yung in Stars Hollow.
RICHARD: Is that, um, saying anything?
LORELAI: Rory, come entertain your Grandpa while your spirited Mommy orders please!
RORY: Hey Grandpa, do you um. . .do you wanna see my room?
RICHARD: Yes, I would.
RORY: Okay.
[Richard walks into Rory's room.]
LORELAI: Twenty bucks if you lock him in there.
RORY: Thirty if you chill.
CUT TO INSIDE RORY'S BEDROOM
[Richard is looking at Rory's bookshelf as Rory walks in]
RICHARD: Interesting.
RORY: What are you doing?
RICHARD: Oh, there are some holes in your collection here and I'm just making a list to fill them.
RORY: Oh, well these aren't all of my books.
RICHARD: Oh?
[Rory shows him several stacks of books under her bed]
RICHARD: Oh my goodness!
RORY: And. . . [opens two drawers filled with books]
RICHARD: Ah, well possibly I should concentrate on acquiring you a bookcase first.
RORY: That's okay. I kind of like my system.
RICHARD: Ah, organized chaos?
RORY: Exactly.
RICHARD: Very well, carry on. Well, I'm glad not to see any death rockers on your walls.
RORY: Grandpa, where did you learn the term death rockers?
RICHARD: Well, I'm not entirely unfamiliar with the music world in which you live.
RORY: I don't exactly live in the death rock world, Grandpa.
RICHARD: Good.
RORY: But if I do move there, I will send you a card.
RICHARD: Oh, I appreciate that. Ah, Harvard.
RORY: Yeah. We started the obsession board a few years ago. And then when we took that trip to Harvard, the student store was having a two for one flag sale, so that kind of sent us into the final stage of the psychosis. Hospitals were called, medications were prescribed, there is no cure.
[Lorelai walks in with a notepad]
LORELAI: Okay, I made the menu for the evening.
RICHARD: My God.
RORY: Looks good.
RICHARD: Who could eat all that food?
LORELAI: I almost added the garlic chicken.
RORY: Add it.
RICHARD: There are only three of us.
LORELAI: Yes, but we like choices.
RORY: Let's call, I'm starved.
[they walk into the kitchen]
RICHARD: Lorelai, you cannot order all of that food. You're teaching your daughter wastefulness and gluttony.
LORELAI: Um Dad, we do this all the time. We order way too much and then we eat like a third of it and live off the leftovers for a week and a half. It's a finely honed system. Now please, just sit and read something or watch TV.
RICHARD: So I uh. . .I noticed all the Harvard paraphernalia in Rory's room.
LORELAI: Oh yeah.
RICHARD: You know, you might not want to get her settled on one specific college quite so soon.
LORELAI: Why not?
RICHARD: Well, she's young. She hasn't investigated her options.
LORELAI: Dad, she wants to go to Harvard.
RICHARD: Well yes, because she thinks you want her to go to Harvard.
LORELAI: I do.
RICHARD: Well, there are a lot of other good schools out there. You know I went to Yale.
LORELAI: Yes, I do know.
RICHARD: Yale is a very fine school, some might argue a better school than Harvard.
LORELAI: Some meaning you?
RICHARD: I just think Rory should explore it, and I can make some phone calls and set up an appointment.
LORELAI: No.
RICHARD: Why not?
LORELAI: Because she wants to go to Harvard.
RICHARD: But that's ridiculous. Who's going to help her get into Harvard?
LORELAI: Reese Witherspoon.
RICHARD: I am a Yale alumnus. I give a great deal of money to that school. Getting her in will be a breeze.
LORELAI: We don't like breezes, they mess up our hair.
RICHARD: Do not be petulant Lorelai.
LORELAI: Do not pick a fight with me Dad.
RICHARD: This is not about you, this is about Rory.
LORELAI: No, this is about Richard interfering.
RICHARD: Now please, just let me handle this. I know more about the Ivy League system than you do.
[a horn honks from outside]
LORELAI: This is not about the - .
RORY: Is that the food already?
LORELAI: No Sweets, I haven't ordered yet.
[Rory looks out the window]
RORY: Oh my God!
LORELAI: Who is it?
RORY: Oh my God!
CUT TO OUT FRONT
[They walk out the front door. Dean is standing in front of a car]
LORELAI: Oh my God.
RORY: Whatcha doin'?
DEAN: Just standing here.
RORY: Next to?
DEAN: A car. Your car.
RORY: No!
DEAN: Finished it yesterday.
RORY: No you didn't!
DEAN: Do you want them? [holds up the keys]
RORY: Ah! [Rory runs off the porch and hugs him]
DEAN: Now if you don't like it, I bet I can sell it to someone else.
RORY: Don't you dare!
LORELAI: Dean, that's amazing!
RORY: Let's drive, can we drive, does it drive?
DEAN: Does it drive?
RORY: Well, no, I know it drives but. . .oh my God! I can't believe you finished it! You built me a car!
LORELAI: Dean, now that you're done with that, will you build me a plane? One that looks like Shamu?
RICHARD: He made that car?
LORELAI: Isn't that incredible?
RICHARD: Well, she can't accept it.
LORELAI: Oh Dad, it's okay.
RICHARD: It's not okay, he's a child. She's not driving a car a child put together.
DEAN: Excuse me sir, but, uh, my father worked on cars and my grandfather worked on cars. I know what I'm doing.
RICHARD: A car is not a model airplane, young man.
DEAN: I know that.
RICHARD: It is a complex vehicle.
DEAN: I know that too.
RICHARD: And I will not have my granddaughter driving around in some contraption you put together in auto shop.
LORELAI: Okay, can I just say something here?
DEAN: I did not make this in auto shop. I am telling you this car is safe.
RICHARD: So, you are a certified mechanic?
DEAN: No.
RICHARD: But you had the assistance of a certified mechanic?
DEAN: No.
RICHARD: Well, then you drove it past a certified mechanic?
LORELAI: Dad, stop it. This is a nice thing Dean did here. Remember, nice things.
RICHARD: I'm sorry, she can't accept it. Now, if you will excuse us, we were about to order dinner.
DEAN: Mr. Gilmore, I understand you want Rory to be safe, but so do I. I would not give this car to her if I did not know for a fact that it was a hundred percent safe. I checked it, my father checked it, and Gypsy at Hewes Brothers checked it. It has been checked.
RICHARD: And I'm just supposed to take your word for it?
DEAN: Nope.
RICHARD: Agreed.
DEAN: Let's go.
RICHARD: Go where?
DEAN: To check it.
RICHARD: I don't think so.
DEAN: I've been working on this car for months. I'm giving it to Rory.
RICHARD: You're a very stubborn boy.
DEAN: Do you wanna drive or should I?
RICHARD: I'll take my own car, thank you.
DEAN: Fine with me.
RICHARD: And drive behind me. I don't want that thing blowing up right in front of the Jag.
DEAN: No problem. Try to keep your electrical system working long enough to get there.
RICHARD: They worked the kinks out of this electrical system years ago, young man. I'll be right back.
DEAN: So will I.
[Dean and Richard get in their cars and drive off.]
LORELAI: Don't you feel like one of us should've been standing between them waving a flag or something?
CUT TO HEWES BROS.
[The mechanic looks under the hood of the car while Richard and Dean stand nearby.]
GYPSY: It looks fine to me.
RICHARD: Check it again.
GYPSY: I already checked it again. This was checking it again. I checked it earlier, that means this was checking it again.
DEAN: Go ahead Gypsy, check it again. I've got all night.
GYPSY: I don't.
RICHARD: Check the transmission.
GYPSY: I did, it's all good.
RICHARD: The carburetor.
GYPSY: All good.
RICHARD: Manifold pressure?
GYPSY: Best manifold pressure I've ever seen.
RICHARD: You've missed something. I insist that you go over this entire car again.
GYPSY: But I'm telling you, there's nothing wrong with this car.
RICHARD: I am paying you for a service, I would like that service performed.
GYPSY: Okay, I look again.
DEAN: How many times are you gonna make her do that?
RICHARD: As many times as it takes.
DEAN: Look, I know you think I'm not good enough for Rory, but do you have to take it out on my car?
RICHARD: She's my only granddaughter. I have a responsibility to protect her. She's young, she's naïve.
DEAN: She's smart.
RICHARD: Yes, she's smart. . .about certain things.
DEAN: Look, I'm not about to do battle with you here. You can hate me - whatever, I don't care.
RICHARD: I hardly hate you.
DEAN: Really?
RICHARD: I don't even know you.
DEAN: Well, I'm right here. What do you wanna know? Besides what college I wanna go to or what I wanna do for a living, because I still have no answers for you on that front.
RICHARD: Those are not ridiculous questions to ask.
DEAN: No, but you could've waited until dessert to get to them.
RICHARD: Yes, well, perhaps the timing of the. . .
DEAN: Interrogation?
RICHARD: Conversation.
DEAN: Conversation.
RICHARD: Perhaps the timing was a little off. [pause] So, your father what does he do?
DEAN: Stereo systems.
RICHARD: Installing them?
DEAN: Selling them. He's got a shop a couple of blocks from here.
RICHARD: And your mother?
DEAN: She works part time transcribing medical records.
RICHARD: Interesting, interesting. So, you. . .you like my granddaughter quite a bit?
DEAN: No, I love your granddaughter quite a bit.
RICHARD: See Dean, I was beginning to feel a little better about this until you said that.
DEAN: Well, I'm not trying to make you feel better, I'm trying to be honest.
RICHARD: Yes, you are. It's an admirable quality.
DEAN: Thank you.
GYPSY: Okay, I found something wrong.
RICHARD: You did?
DEAN: What?
GYPSY: Windshield wipers came right off in my hand, very dangerous. Thank God I check it again.
DEAN: Gypsy, you broke those off yourself.
GYPSY: Yes I did.
DEAN: Put them back!
GYPSY: I can't look at this car anymore.
DEAN: Gypsy!
GYPSY: I miss my home.
DEAN: Put them back.
RICHARD: Now I suppose the car is safe.
DEAN: It is.
RICHARD: I'm still not sure it's an appropriate gift.
DEAN: I understand that.
RICHARD: How tall are you?
DEAN: Why, you wanna dance?
RICHARD: No, thank you. I appreciate the offer though.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai and Rory sit on the couch.]
RORY: How long are they going to be?
LORELAI: I don't know. Knowing my dad, he probably made Dean take the entire thing apart and put it back together again in front of him.
RORY: Poor Dean.
LORELAI: Poor Dean, he has to spend one evening with him. I share chromosomes with the guy.
[Richard walks through the front door]
RICHARD: Well, we had it thoroughly checked. We found a little problem with the windshield wipers. Dean is there now adjusting them. But once that is taken care of, I don't see any reason why, with proper insurance of course, why you can't have that car.
RORY: Really? Thanks!
LORELAI: Hey hon, why don't you run and pick up the food for us?
RORY: Oh sure.
RICHARD: Oh, I've got this.
LORELAI: Here you go, hurry! Before the mu shu congeals.
RORY: Okay. [leaves]
RICHARD: Why didn't you let me pay?
LORELAI: I didn't think it would be, um, appropriate under the circumstances.
RICHARD: What circumstances are those?
LORELAI: The ones where I'm about to get really, really mad at you.
RICHARD: Excuse me?
LORELAI: Dad, this is my house in my town, where I live my life.
RICHARD: Well, thank you for the geography lesson.
LORELAI: No, I'm - in the thirty two years we've known each other, have I once come to your work and criticized the way you handled your clients?
RICHARD: I don't remember you coming to my work at all.
LORELAI: Well, have I passed judgment on your breakfast habits or your clothing choices?
RICHARD: I was offering opinions.
LORELAI: Well, don't. I don't want your opinions, especially not in front of my employees and not in front of my friends.
RICHARD: I guess you can't take constructive criticism.
LORELAI: Nothing that came out of your mouth today might, in any universe visited by Kirk or Spock, be construed as constructive.
RICHARD: I beg to differ.
LORELAI: And this is absolutely the last time you come into my house and overrule my word.
RICHARD: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: I'm talking about Dean and the car.
RICHARD: I was being - .
LORELAI: You have no right being anything. Rory's my kid and I make the rules, so if she comes home one day and says, Hey, uh, I'm gonna spend the weekend with Patricia Krenwinkle' and I say, Okay, grab a sweater', you just have to deal.
RICHARD: Who is Patricia Krenwinkle?
LORELAI: And if I tell her that she can have the car that her boyfriend made for her, then she can.
RICHARD: I didn't think it looked safe.
LORELAI: You don't have to think it looks safe! I have to think it looks safe! God, why can't I make you hear what I'm saying?
RICHARD: Oh, I hear exactly what you're saying.
LORELAI: You came here not as a guest but as the judgment police, you kept your uniform on the whole time, and you know what, it comes off now!
RICHARD: Lower your voice.
LORELAI: No! I am a grown woman and you will treat me the way you treat people who have invited you to their house or you will not be invited again.
RICHARD: Invited?
LORELAI: Yes!
RICHARD: Don't you think I know why you invited me here?
LORELAI: Because - .
RICHARD: Because your mother asked you too. She called you up and said I was driving her crazy, and would you please take me off her hands for one day so she can get some peace. Isn't that true?
LORELAI: No.
RICHARD: You have never once invited me to your house Lorelai, never. And I can hardly point to an event that would prompt you to do so except my recent employment situation.
LORELAI: Okay Dad, Mom did call me but - .
RICHARD: You know, I never thought about retirement. I never thought about what I would do or what I would be once I wasn't working. I never once imagined that I would go from being a productive member of the human race to a decrepit old drone sitting at the club at three in the afternoon drinking brandy and playing cards.
LORELAI: Aw, Dad.
RICHARD: I am an annoyance to my wife and a burden to my daughter. Suddenly I realize what it feels like to be obsolete. I hope that you never have to learn what that feels like. Now, if you will excuse me, I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check on dinner. I'm not very hungry.
CUT TO SIDEWALK
[Rory walks past the video store, which her picture is in the window. As she stares at it, Jess walks over to her.]
JESS: Nice picture.
RORY: Gee, thanks.
JESS: You're very popular right now. I bet if you burn a few books, they'll probably make you mayor.
RORY: This is ridiculous.
JESS: I don't know, bet you have a lot of supporters on this. Pat Buchanon, Jerry Falwell, Kathie Lee Gifford.
RORY: Bye.
JESS: Aw, come on, it's a little funny.
RORY: No, being the poster girl for censorship is not a little funny. The only videos not behind that curtain are Bambi and Dumbo. I mean, they actually had a meeting earlier about whether or not Babe should be behind the curtain so as not to offend people who keep kosher.
JESS: It's a crazy world we live in.
RORY: And where did they even find that stupid picture?
JESS: Oh no, the picture's good. It's the people who are stupid.
RORY: I'm never gonna be able to leave my house again.
JESS: Well, at least you won't starve.
RORY: I can't look at it anymore.
JESS: Relax. I don't think it'll be around very long.
RORY: Why?
JESS: Just a guess.
RORY: Jess!
JESS: Enjoy the food.
RORY: Come back here.
JESS: Why?
RORY: I'll give you an eggroll.
JESS: Yes?
RORY: What did you do?
JESS: Nothing much. Just wanted to make sure whoever rented Dumbo or Bambi gets a little surprise.
RORY: What kind of surprise? What did you do?
JESS: You owe me an eggroll. [walks away]
RORY: Blech.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Richard walks in the front door.]
EMILY: Richard, there you are, sneaking in like that.
RICHARD: Hello Emily.
EMILY: It's nice to see you.
RICHARD: Well, you seem very happy.
EMILY: Well, I had a very nice day. Would you like a drink?
RICHARD: Uh, no thanks.
EMILY: I saw Cheeky Lennox today. She's redoing her entire house and I have to say, it's given me a few ideas about this place. I won't scare you with them tonight but I'm very excited about it.
RICHARD: Well I'm glad.
EMILY: Then I did a little shopping and I had my nails done.
RICHARD: Very nice.
EMILY: Sugar and spice, a little crazier than I usually wear but I don't know, I was just in that kind of a mood. So how was your day with the girls?
RICHARD: Wonderful.
EMILY: Tell me about it.
RICHARD: Well, I saw the town, I saw Lorelai's work.
EMILY: Did you eat? Because I can have Heloise whip up something for you.
RICHARD: No thank you, we had Chinese food.
EMILY: Oh, you love Chinese food!
RICHARD: Yes I do.
EMILY: Well I'm thrilled that you had such a wonderful time. It was good for you to get out like that.
RICHARD: Yes it was. In fact, I'm still a little energized from the day, so I think I'm finally gonna organize all those stamps that I've been talking about for ages.
EMILY: Now?
RICHARD: Why not?
EMILY: Well, I think that would be wonderful. Have fun.
[Richard walks into his office and sits down]

OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW
[We see several signs near the gazebo promoting the upcoming Stars Hollow "Bid on a Basket" Fundraiser before we see Lorelai and Rory inside Doose's Market looking at baskets.]
LORELAI: So I've decided I'm saving myself for William Holden.
RORY: Wow, it's nice out here in left field.
LORELAI: Hey, I'm sorry. Sunset Boulevard was on last night, and I don't knowI've known him for years Sabrina, Stalag 17 and yet last night something snapped.
RORY: I'll say.
LORELAI: I think it was the monkey scene.
RORY: You know he's dead, don't you?
LORELAI: The monkey?
RORY: William Holden!
LORELAI: Ugh, every great relationship has its obstacles. You'd know that if you weren't dating Andy Hardy.
RORY: This one?
LORELAI: Hm, no.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: It's too big, it raises expectations.
RORY: Like there's actually a home-cooked lunch in there?
LORELAI: Instead of whatever is leftover in our refrigerator - exactly.
RORY: Okay, going back on the pile now.
LORELAI: Oh, it's quaint, isn't it? The women get to make a nice lunch basket, the men get to bid on it, and the world rotates backwards on its axis.
RORY: I think it's fun.
LORELAI: That's because you have a pretty boy to bid on your basket.
RORY: Yes I do.
LORELAI: Did you tell him to eat lunch first?
RORY: Hi, I love him, of course. Hey, I'm gonna look in the back.
LORELAI: All right, I'll hit the front. [walks up front] Hey Patty. Shopping for baskets?
MISS PATTY: Oh please, I bought my basket weeks ago.
LORELAI: Always prepared.
MISS PATTY: Well, I'm getting that itch again.
LORELAI: Oh no, Patty, you don't actually need another husband.
MISS PATTY: Well, need no, but want that's a different story. Listen darling, do you happen to have change for a dollar?
LORELAI: I think so.
MISS PATTY: I don't know where my quarters go.
LORELAI: Down some guy's g-string, I would expect.
MISS PATTY: Oh no, a quarter would be insulting.
LORELAI: Here you go.
MISS PATTY: Oh, thank you so. . . ugh! [drops something out of her wallet]
LORELAI: I got it. [bends down to pick it up]
MISS PATTY: Oh no no , that's okay.
LORELAI: This is a picture of me.
MISS PATTY: It is?
LORELAI: Yeah. Why do you have a picture of me in your wallet?
MISS PATTY: Oh, uh, well, it's a very nice picture.
LORELAI: Thank you. Why do you have a very nice picture of me in your wallet?
MISS PATTY: I'm a stalker?
LORELAI: Or?
MISS PATTY: Or when, in my daily travels, I run across a nice single guy...
LORELAI: Oh God!
MISS PATTY: I like to have a visual aid to help me with the wonderful buildup I give you.
LORELAI: Patty, I appreciate the gesture but I don't need you to try to set me up.
MISS PATTY: You're such a beautiful girl and you deserve a nice guy.
LORELAI: I'll have a nice guy, but let me find him, okay?
MISS PATTY: But you're no good at finding him.
LORELAI: Patty.
MISS PATTY: Oh, all right.
LORELAI: Thank you. I'll keep this if you don't mind.
MISS PATTY: Stubborn girl.
[cut to Rory in the back looking at baskets. Dean walks up to her]
DEAN: Not that one.
RORY: You get no say in the basket.
DEAN: I have to bid on it.
RORY: And you have to eat what's inside it and you get no say in that either.
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Yeah?
DEAN: Is Taylor behind me?
RORY: No. [they kiss; a noise interrupts them]
DEAN: What? Taylor? [he turns around to look] Jess.
JESS: Sorry to intrude.
DEAN: Then why did you?
JESS: Well, you're having your vertical From Here to Eternity moment right in front of the super glue.
RORY: Oh.
JESS: Not that that's not an appropriate place to be doing it in front of but - .
DEAN: Here's your glue.
JESS: Thanks. As you were. [walks away]
DEAN: I really hate that guy.
RORY: He didn't do anything.
DEAN: He's here, he's breathing, that's enough.
RORY: I really wish you two could start over.
DEAN: Why?
RORY: Because he lives here and we run into him. He goes to school here. I just think it'd be easier.
DEAN: I'm fine with the whole hating him thing, thank you.
RORY: I just think it's a waste of energy.
DEAN: You know, I'll have a PowerBar.
RORY: Fine, forget it.
DEAN: So, uh, I should probably get back to work. We still on for tonight?
RORY: I don't know. I might be baking.
DEAN: I'll pick you up at seven. Get that one, it's nice and small.
RORY: Bye.
[Dean walks away; Jess walks back over and startles Rory]
RORY: God!
JESS: Sorry. Two for one sale.
[opening credits]
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Lorelai is behind the front desk on the phone.]
LORELAI: Independence Inn, Lorelai speakingOh sure. Uh, what dates are you looking at? Hold on one sec. . . Um, would you like a king or a queen size bed? . . . Well, you have your choice. I've got a room with a king size and a room with two queens. . . Uh huh. . Oh, well, do you think you'll make up by then? . . . Ugh. Yikes, well, I would take the room with the two queens. . . Uh huh. . . Uh huh. . . Oh God! Uh, sorry, no, nothing, nothing's wrong. I. . everything's . .yes, great, call me back when you know. Okay. Thank you.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Lorelai walks through the door]
LORELAI: So Patty has taken it upon herself to find me a man.
SOOKIE: Oh really?
LORELAI: Yes. Here in my hand I have the pictures and resumes of the top three contenders.
SOOKIE: Anyone good?
LORELAI: No, but two of them have run with the bulls. This is so humiliating. I can find my own man.
SOOKIE: She just loves you.
LORELAI: Yeah, but . . .you know, ew!
SOOKIE: Ugh.
[Jackson walks in]
JACKSON: Sookie?
SOOKIE: Jackson, don't look!
JACKSON: What?
SOOKIE: Cover your eyes!
JACKSON: Okay, okay. I'm sorry, now why am I doing this?
SOOKIE: Because I'm baking for the picnic tomorrow and it's supposed to be a surprise.
JACKSON: Oh sure, never see a pie before an auction, it's bad luck.
LORELAI: Okay, uh, you guys talk, I have to go call Patty and stop the forced mating process. I feel like Ling-Ling the panda bear. Oh, hey, one of them's seen Ghostbusters 124 times. Can you say score? [leaves]
SOOKIE: Okay, what's up?
JACKSON: Well. . . I'm sorry, can I put my hand down? I need to look at you when I talk.
SOOKIE: Uh, hold on. Go.
JACKSON: I got a call from my landlord today reminding me that my lease is up at the end of this month.
SOOKIE: Uh huh.
JACKSON: So, of course, he wanted to know whether I was gonna re-up it or not.
SOOKIE: Uh huh.
JACKSON: But I told him that I had to talk to you first.
SOOKIE: Okay. About what?
JACKSON: About re-upping my lease.
SOOKIE: Mm hmm.
JACKSON: So what do you think?
SOOKIE: About re-upping your lease?
JACKSON: Yes.
SOOKIE: Well, you have a very nice kitchen.
JACKSON: Yes, I know.
SOOKIE: And I like your living room. Though that house across the street has sort of that creepy Miami Beach blue, which means that during the day you really can't look out your window, but at night it's not so bad.
JACKSON: Sookie, forget about the house across the street.
SOOKIE: Well, if you forget about the house across the street, I don't see why you shouldn't.
JACKSON: You don't?
SOOKIE: Nope.
JACKSON: Oh, okay, fine. Um, I just wanted to check with you first.
SOOKIE: Oh, I appreciate that.
JACKSON: So, um, I guess I'll go re-up my lease then.
SOOKIE: Sounds good.
JACKSON: Yeah. Sounds good.
CUT TO SIDEWALK
[The day of the fundraiser, Lorelai and Rory walk down the street with their baskets]
LORELAI: You know what's wonderful about this festival?
RORY: No, what?
LORELAI: That it always falls on the day after trash day. Therefore, all the stuff that you forgot to throw out that you would normally be stuck with for another whole week, you can instead put in a pretty basket and auction off for charity.
RORY: That is wonderful.
[Lane runs up behind them]
LANE: Okay, I've got it all worked out.
RORY: Tell please.
LANE: Well, I invited my cousin David to come and bid on my basket, you know, to keep my mother happy.
LORELAI: Uh huh.
LANE: Then when he gets it, we tell my mom we're gonna go eat over at the park where Henry's gonna call on the pay phone at exactly two o'clock for the all is clear' sigh. Then David, with the twenty bucks I give him, will disappear, Henry will arrive, and we'll finally have out first official date.
LORELAI: My head is spinning.
LANE: Stash this at Miss Patty's for me, okay?
RORY: Don't you need this for David to bid on?
LANE: Oh no, my mom packed that one. You know, homemade granola, wheat grass juice, soy chicken taco.
LORELAI: Suddenly our lunches are looking pretty good.
LANE: This is the Henry basket. I went by Gianelli's and stopped in and picked up a couple of meatball heroes and some chips. I also packed a change of clothes, makeup, makeup remover, and three temporary tattoos.
LORELAI: Sure, cause four would be trashy.
LANE: I gotta go. I gotta sneak back into my house. Oh, I'm so excited! [leaves]
LORELAI: Ah man. I remember the days of lying to my mother about a boy. Once I had a boy hidden in the closet and of course Mom wouldn't leave, so I finally had to pretend to get sick to my stomach just to get her out of the room long enough for him to climb out the window and down the tree. He fell, broke his leg. Ah, to be young again.
CUT TO AUCTION
[A crowd is gathered in front of the gazebo filled with baskets. Taylor stands at a podium in front as the auctioneer]
TAYLOR: Sold for fifteen dollars to the man in the yellow. Thank you very much. Now the next basket I have here is a lovely green wicker number that would be a charming addition to any room once the lunch is gone. Let's start the bidding at five dollars. Do I hear five?
DAVID: Five dollars.
TAYLOR: Okay, I have five dollars. Do I hear ten?
KIRK: Ten dollars. [Mrs. Kim glares at him] Withdrawn.
TAYLOR: Okay, I'm still at five, do I hear ten? Five going once, five going twice, sold to the young man for five dollars. You know what's nice, you can put a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper in there and stick it someplace in the bathroom decorative and convenient. Now this next one may not look like much ...
RORY: Mine.
LORELAI: Nice.
TAYLOR: ... but remember people good things come in small packages.
LORELAI: How badly does he want to be hosting a game show?
RORY: Hm, he can taste it.
TAYLOR: Let's start the bidding at three dollars.
RORY: Hey!
DEAN: Five dollars.
TAYLOR: Now that's the kind of bidding we want to hear today.
LORELAI: He's good. He's very good.
TAYLOR: Five dollars, do I hear ten dollars?
JESS: Ten dollars.
TAYLOR: Okay, I have ten dollars. Do I have fifteen?
JESS: Twenty.
TAYLOR: Twenty dollars, do I hear twenty-five?
DEAN: Thirty.
TAYLOR: Okay, see, you boys don't seem to understand the way this thing works.
JESS: Forty dollars.
DEAN: Fifty dollars.
TAYLOR: Excuse me, have either of you noticed how tiny this thing is?
JESS: Seventy-five.
TAYLOR: Now we're not talking cents gentlemen, we're talking dollars remember.
LORELAI: Uh oh. Dean's hesitating.
DEAN: Eighty.
RORY: He does not have eighty dollars to spend on that basket.
TAYLOR: Eighty? Eighty dollars?
JESS: Ninety.
TAYLOR: Ninety dollars, is that correct?
LORELAI: You know, I don't think he'll have to.
TAYLOR: Okay, we've got ninety going once, ninety dollars going twice. . . sold to the nice young hoodlum in the back for ninety dollars.
LORELAI: I'm trying to think, uh, in what scenario this situation could be construed as positive.
RORY: Well . . .
LORELAI: Well, no one's head's on fire.
RORY: I better go talk to Dean.
LORELAI: Do you want some help?
RORY: No, it's okay. I'm just officially not a fan of unpredictability.
LORELAI: I totally understand. Good luck.
[Rory walks over to Dean as the auction goes on in the background]
TAYLOR: Five dollars on this one, do I hear five dollars?
MAN: Five!
TAYLOR: Five dollars, that's good. Thanks you, how about ten dollars?
MAN: I'll go ten!
TAYLOR: Ten dollars - let's keep going. Look at the size of this . . .
[cut to Rory and Dean talking behind the gazebo]
DEAN: I'm gonna k*ll him.
RORY: Dean, he was probably just fooling around or something.
DEAN: No, he was messing with me.
RORY: I don't - .
DEAN: He was messing with me and it's the last time, I swear to God.
RORY: Dean, calm down.
DEAN: Why would he do this?
RORY: Maybe he was hungry.
DEAN: He's trying to make me crazy.
RORY: Just don't let him.
[Jess walks up behind them]
JESS: I gotta tell you, of all the nutty barn raising shindigs this town can cook up, this one wasn't half bad.
DEAN: Glad you enjoyed it.
JESS: Yes I did. So shall we?
DEAN: Shall we what?
JESS: Shall we go?
DEAN: Go where?
JESS: Go eat.
DEAN: Excuse me?
JESS: The person who buys the basket wins the company of the person who makes the basket for lunch. Basket, basket maker, guy who didn't bring enough money.
DEAN: You think this is funny.
JESS: Well, it's no Lenny Bruce routine but it has its moments.
DEAN: Bye Jess.
JESS: Where you going?
DEAN: You're the one who's going.
JESS: Oh, as soon as Rory is ready.
DEAN: She's not going with you.
JESS: Really, is that true?
DEAN: Yes, it's true.
JESS: Excuse me Edgar Bergen, I think I'd like Charlie McCarthy to answer now.
DEAN: Shut up.
RORY: Dean.
DEAN: What?
RORY: Well
DEAN: Oh, come on!
RORY: It's tradition.
DEAN: I don't believe this.
RORY: It's true. My mother and I have been doing this every year since we moved here.
DEAN: So buck tradition.
RORY: Are you kidding? Do you remember how mad Taylor was when I was sick and I couldn't go to the turkey-calling contest?
DEAN: This isn't school, you're not getting graded.
RORY: Just don't make this into a big thing.
DEAN: Don't go.
JESS: Oh geez man, she's not shipping off to Nam.
DEAN: You SO need to shut up now.
RORY: Look, Dean, it's a picnic, it's lunch. We'll sit, we'll eat, it's over.
DEAN: No.
RORY: What do you think's gonna happen?
JESS: Yeah, I think I'd like to hear this one also.
DEAN: I don't want you to go.
RORY: Dean!
DEAN: Fine, forget it, go. [walks away]
RORY: [follows him] Please don't walk away like that.
DEAN: Sorry, I'd do a silly walk but I'm not feeling very John Cleese right now.
RORY: Dean, this isn't my fault. I didn't ask him to do that, I didn't tell him to do that. Dean, you're my boyfriend. I would never do anything to hurt you.
DEAN: Yeah? You're doing it right now. [walks away]
CUT TO AUCTION
TAYLOR: Going once, going twice. . .sold for twenty-five dollars! Congratulations. Thank you. Oh Lord, will you look at this? Ladies and gentlemen, now this is a basket.

KIRK: Ten dollars.
ANDREW: Fifteen dollars.
TAYLOR: I have fifteen dollars.
KIRK: Twenty dollars.
TAYLOR: Twenty dollars, I have twenty dollars. Is that my final offer?

TAYLOR: Thirty-five going once, thirty-five going twice. . .sold to Kirk for thirty-five dollars.
KIRK: Yes, finally! You know, if it hadn't have been for me I could've had it for twenty-five.
[Sookie and Jackson walk away from the crowd]
SOOKIE: Hey, what is wrong with you? I gave you all the signals. The pointing, the waving, the mouthing That's my basket.' Didn't you see the mouthing?
JACKSON: Yes, I saw the mouthing.
SOOKIE: Well, why didn't you bid?
JACKSON: I don't know. It just didn't feel right.
SOOKIE: What are you talking about, it didn't feel right? I made four kinds of pesto and three different desserts. Plus the entire basket is an edible pretzel with a goat cheese filling.
JACKSON: Well, I hope Kirk enjoys it.
SOOKIE: I don't understand.
JACKSON: Oh, come on Sookie.
SOOKIE: What?
JACKSON: I told you that the lease was up on my apartment, and I asked you if you thought that I should renew the lease on my apartment and you said yes!
SOOKIE: Do you not like that apartment?
JACKSON: No, I love that apartment. It's perfect, the ultimate bachelor pad. It's just big enough for one.
SOOKIE: Oh.
JACKSON: Only here's the thing. You and I, we've been dating for awhile and I don't know, I thought things were going pretty well.
SOOKIE: Things are going really well.
JACKSON: Okay, so I had this crazy thought that since things were going really well that maybe it was time to take a step forward.
SOOKIE: You wanted to move in together?
JACKSON: Well, I at least wanted to consider moving in together.
SOOKIE: Oh, uh, I hadn't even thought about it.
JACKSON: You hadn't?
SOOKIE: Well, no.
JACKSON: Oh, my mistake then. I thought we were on the same wavelength. We weren't, no problem, enjoy your lunch.
SOOKIE: Jackson, I lied. I have thought about it - a lot. Our bathroom's gonna be pink. I'm sorry.
JACKSON: Well, why didn't you say something?
SOOKIE: I didn't want to ruin anything. We're doing so well, we have so much fun, it's all working.
JACKSON: Why would living together mess all that up?
SOOKIE: I don't know. We'd see each other every day.
JACKSON: We see each other every day now.
SOOKIE: And you'd find out all my annoying little quirks.
JACKSON: Hey, I've got annoying quirks too, you know.
SOOKIE: I know.
JACKSON: What's that supposed to mean?
SOOKIE: And you might get sick of me.
JACKSON: Or you might get sick of me.
SOOKIE: No, that's not gonna happen.
JACKSON: Well, if that's not gonna happen, then what's the problem?
SOOKIE: The problem is that Kirk is gonna eat my goat cheese basket.
JACKSON: Not if I have anything to say about it. [they kiss] How's that for not getting sick of you? Now if you'll excuse me, I got a basket to get.
[cut back to auction]
TAYLOR: Next up why, that looks like a Doose's market basket. Nice, huh?

[Lorelai bursts through the door]
LORELAI: Luke! Where is he, where is he? I need him! Caesar, where is - agh, agh, thank God. Hey, hey, you gotta come with me.
LUKE: What are you doing? Hey hey, I got plates here!
LORELAI: Put the burgers down. Caeser, you're in charge.
LUKE: Now wait.
LORELAI: Do you have money? I need money. Which one opens this thing? Is it that one, not that one.
LUKE: Stop messing with that.
LORELAI: Luke, you gotta come out there with me. Patty gave my picture out to all these guys because she thinks I need a man.
LUKE: You do, one with a nice couch and a deep knowledge of Freud.
LORELAI: You have to come out and bid on my basket.
LUKE: Are you serious?
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: I have never in my life taken part in one of these crazy group flip outs. I'm not about to start now.
LORELAI: But - right now - out there the -.
LUKE: Just buy your own basket.
LORELAI: I cannot buy my own basket.
LUKE: Why not?
LORELAI: Because that is pathetic.
LUKE: And chasing me around my diner begging me to buy your basket?
LORELAI: Also pathetic. But that is a pathetic I can live with, where that pathetic is a truly pathetic pathetic, and only you can save me from the double pathetic! Please!
LUKE: I can't believe I'm doing this.
LORELAI: Ha ha! Hurry up. Hurry up!
[Lorelai rushes him out the door]

LUKE: Forty-seven dollars, are you kidding?
LORELAI: Luke!
GUY 2: Forty-seven fifty!
LUKE: For what? Two stale Pop Tarts and a Slim Jim?
LORELAI: Okay, you're not getting the whole saving me here thing, are you?
LUKE: Fine. Forty-eight.
GUY 1: Forty-eight fifty.
LUKE: Forty-nine.
GUY 2: Forty-nine fifty.
LUKE: Uh, fifty-two fifty.

LORELAI: Oh, please God.
TAYLOR: Sold for fifty-two fifty.

LORELAI: You rock!
LUKE: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
LUKE: So what do we do now?
LORELAI: I guess we eat.
LUKE: This?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: First I have to buy it, then I have to eat it?
LORELAI: Hey, the basket of botulism does come with my company.
LUKE: Huh. You don't eat with your mouth open do you?
LORELAI: Women don't eat at all. We just look at food and jump on the treadmill.
LUKE: All right, let's go.
[cut to Rory standing alone as Jess walks up to her]
JESS: You know, there's nothing there.
RORY: Yes, I know.
JESS: You going after him?
RORY: Not right now.
JESS: So then, shall we?
RORY: Fine, come on.
CUT TO BENCH
[Kirk is going through Sookie's basket as Jackson walks over to him]
JACKSON: I've been looking all over for you.
KIRK: Any idea what this is?
JACKSON: Uh, yeah, it's a pineapplecranberry chutney.
KIRK: Ech.
JACKSON: Listen, I'd like to talk to you about this basket. As you know, Sookie made it and since Sookie and I are seeing each other, naturally she assumed that I would bid on it.
KIRK: Where are the carrot sticks? Every lunch has carrot sticks.
JACKSON: But see, I was a little upset about a fight we had had, and so I didn't bid on the basket.
KIRK: I love carrot sticks, especially the crinkle cut kind.
JACKSON: However, we just made up and now I'd like to have lunch with Sookie, so. . . I need the basket.
KIRK: This is my basket.
JACKSON: Yes, but I'd like you to give it to me so that I can have lunch with Sookie.
KIRK: I bought this basket. The rules are whoever bids the highest gets to keep the basket.
JACKSON: Yeah, I understand the rules but - .
KIRK: I bid the highest, I bought the basket, I get the basket.
JACKSON: Okay Kirk, I'll pay you for it. I'll give you forty-five dollars, that's ten dollars more than you paid for it.
KIRK: No.
JACKSON: Okay, fifty dollars.
KIRK: No.
JACKSON: Kirk, this is insane. I'll buy you another basket.
KIRK: I don't need you to buy me another basket. I won this one. You can't just come by and take it away. Just because you have a girlfriend and she made this basket for you doesn't give you the right to bully those of us who don't have girlfriends or anybody to make a basket for them.
JACKSON: Well, I wasn't trying to bully you.
KIRK: Not this year, not last year, not the year before that.
JACKSON: Okay Kirk.
KIRK: My mother didn't even make one for me.
JACKSON: Oh, that's very sad.
KIRK: She made one for all my brothers and sisters but not for me.
JACKSON: That's terrible, Kirk.
KIRK: Twelve brothers and sisters, the only one without a basket me.
JACKSON: Okay Kirk, what's it gonna take?
KIRK: Two hundred and fifty dollars.
JACKSON: Kirk, you're kidding me.
KIRK: Twelve brothers and sisters.
JACKSON: Will you take a check?
KIRK: With two forms of ID.
JACKSON: I swear, you better be as pathetic as you sound.
KIRK: Oh, trust me
CUT TO BENCH

DAVID: Great, can I have his lunch now?
LANE: I'll be right back.
CUT TO GAZEBO
[Lorelai and Luke sit on the bench]
LORELAI: We're supposed to be eating on the ground.
LUKE: Says who?
LORELAI: Every picture you've ever seen of a picnic shows people eating on the ground.
LUKE: Yes, and every time I have seen a picture of people eating on the ground I've thought, what the hell are you people doing sitting on the ground? Spring for some beach chairs, you cheapskates.
[Lane runs up into the gazebo]
LANE: Hey Lorelai, do you have your cell phone?
LORELAI: Yeah, is everything okay hon?
LANE: I just need to make a call.
LORELAI: Here you go.

[Lane walks away as Luke stands up]
LORELAI: Hey, where are you going?
LUKE: I am going to the diner, I am going to get us some edible food and I'm gonna bring it back here for us to eat.
LORELAI: That is so not the point of today. I made this. I am insulted. I will now proceed to pout.
LUKE: I'll bring back some brownies.
LORELAI: Ooh, the pouting has left the building.
[cut to Lane on the cell phone]
HENRY: Hello?
LANE: Hello, Henry?
HENRY: Lane, I've been trying to call you.
LANE: I know, the pay phone is broken.
HENRY: I thought the number was wrong and I didn't know what to do, so I. . .
LANE: What, you what?
HENRY: I called your house and your mother answered.
LANE: What did you say?
HENRY: I asked for you and then she asked why, and I said because and she said because why, and I got nervous and tried to sell her a subscription to the Wall Street Journal.
LANE: Oh, were you successful?
HENRY: Lane.
LANE: Sorry, but at least she doesn't know, right?
HENRY: I guess not.
LANE: Okay, then we're still good. Can you meet me now?
HENRY: I don't know.
LANE: I know it's later than we planned, but we still have a little time and I saved your lunch from David.
HENRY: David?
LANE: My cousin, the decoy.
HENRY: Oh, right.
LANE: So we'll rendezvous where I told you. Just drive by, honk twice, go around the block, and the second time you pass I'll jump in the car.
HENRY: Gee, do you even want me to slow down?
LANE: Well yeah, of course. I mean, not to a total stop -.
HENRY: Lane, I don't think this is gonna work out.
LANE: What
HENRY: This - you, me.
LANE: Are you breaking up with me?
HENRY: How can I break up with you? I've never been out with you.
LANE: Well yeah, but that's what today was supposed to be, a date.
HENRY: A date where we need a secret plan and a two-honk driveby and a decoy cousin?
LANE: Well, yeah.
HENRY: Lane, I like you but I want to be able to actually pick you up, stop the car, and take you out. And I wanna be able to call you, at your house.
LANE: I'm gonna tell my mother, I promise.
HENRY: When?
LANE: Soon.
HENRY: Yeah. Look, I've got prom coming up and my friends and I are gonna rent a limo to take us there and I wanna go, and I wanna take a date.
LANE: Well, I'm sure I can figure something out. Maybe Rory can .
HENRY: I asked somebody else.
LANE: Oh.
HENRY: I'm sorry, I just figured you'd never be able to go and - .
LANE: No, it's okay, that's good. You should've asked someone else.
HENRY: I do like you Lane.
LANE: Okay, well, thank you, I appreciate that. I have to go.
HENRY: Lane.
CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES
[Lane walks up to the house as Mrs. Kim walks out.]
MRS. KIM: David came by here fifteen minutes ago, said you ran off somewhere! Where did you run?
LANE: Nowhere.
MRS. KIM: Who is he?
LANE: Who?
MRS. KIM: The boy you ran off to see! The one who calls here pretending to work for the Wall Street Journal!
LANE: There's no boy.
MRS. KIM: You know the rules, no boys! Not unless I approve and I don't approve!
LANE: How do you know?
MRS. KIM: I know, I know! You're sneaking, you're lying, that means something's wrong with this boy!
LANE: There's nothing wrong with this boy. He's perfect and he likes me and I was so afraid to tell you about him that now he's gonna take somebody else to the prom and I blew it!
MRS. KIM: You go upstairs right now and calm down!
LANE: Fine!
MRS. KIM: Now!
LANE: Fine! [stomps up the stairs]
MRS. KIM: That is not calming down!
[cut to Rory and Jess walks towards the bridge]
JESS: Where do you wanna eat?
RORY: Don't care.
JESS: Okay.
RORY: Where are you going?
JESS: Thought you didn't care.
RORY: I'm not jumping in the lake.
JESS: No underwater dining, got it.
RORY: Now what?
JESS: Now we sit.
RORY: Here?
JESS: Yup.
RORY: On the bridge, that's where we're gonna eat?
JESS: Yup.
RORY: Okay.
JESS: Yeah, I like this place.
RORY: Wow. A place in Stars Hollow you actually like. I'm stunned.
JESS: It's got some good memories. You see right over there?
RORY: Yup.
JESS: That's where Luke pushed me in.
RORY: Huh.
JESS: Yeah.
RORY: It's nice.
JESS: It is.
RORY: So why'd you do it?
JESS: Do what?
RORY: Outbid Dean like that.
JESS: I don't know. I guess it started as a joke just to bug him, but then he just got so mad, you know? And he is so tall, and I just was looking at him and he's standing there all tall and mad and I just. . .I don't know. It was. . .it was really funny.
RORY: It wasn't funny.
JESS: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't intend to do it. Does that make you feel any better?
RORY: I just don't wanna be in a fight with Dean.
JESS: I'm sorry about that. You wanna push me in the lake? It's cathartic, I hear.
RORY: Hm, maybe in a little.
JESS: Whatever. So why don't we open this thing?
RORY: Go ahead.
[Jess opens the picnic basket]
JESS: Wow. Not one thing in here that I would remotely consider eating.
RORY: Well, I didn't make it for you. I made it for Dean.
JESS: And Dean would've eaten this? [holds up a container]
RORY: Yes, he would have.
[Jess tastes a forkful of the food and makes a face]
JESS: Dean is an idiot.
RORY: Dean never would've fallen for that.
JESS: Ah, ha ha.
[cut to Jackson and Sookie sitting on a blanket]
SOOKIE: I can't believe he wouldn't take your check.
JACKSON: Well, apparently, I don't look like my picture.
SOOKIE: He's a loon.
JACKSON: Yeah. It's okay. I'm paying him off in weekly installment in crinkle cut carrot sticks.
SOOKIE: I'm glad we made up.
JACKSON: Yeah, me too.
SOOKIE: And you know, if you still wanted to talk about, you know, what we were talking about, we could talk about it now.
JACKSON: Hmm, nah.
SOOKIE: Excuse me?
JACKSON: I don't know. I'm having second thoughts.
SOOKIE: You are?
JACKSON: Yeah. I mean, living together - big deal, right?
SOOKIE: Oh right. Big deal. Who cares? Not me. No siree, Bob. So, I'm sorry, you don't think we should live together anymore?
JACKSON: Nope.
SOOKIE: Okay.
JACKSON: I think we should get married.
SOOKIE: What?
JACKSON: I think we should get married.
SOOKIE: But uh, but. . .
JACKSON: Soon.
SOOKIE: Are you pregnant?
JACKSON: What do you say? Sookie?
SOOKIE: Yes! I say yes. Oh my God, we're getting married! You do know that this means we'll have to live together, right?
JACKSON: Yes I do.
SOOKIE: Okay, good.
[Cut to Luke and Lorelai sitting in the gazebo]
LORELAI: You know, your burgers actually taste better outside.
LUKE: Good. Next time the roof in the diner's leaking, I'll just rip the stupid thing off.
LORELAI: So this is nice, huh? Come on, admit it.
LUKE: Never.
LORELAI: What? Admit it, you would much rather be sitting out here than inside working.
LUKE: The diner's probably on fire by now.
LORELAI: You are stubborn.
LUKE: I'm stubborn?
LORELAI: Yeah, you're stubborn.
LUKE: You're Miss Flexibility over here?
LORELAI: Hey, I can be flexible.
LUKE: Please.
LORELAI: I can. As long as everything is exactly the way I want it, I'm totally flexible.
LUKE: Ah, well, my mistake.
LORELAI: Do you want a fry?
LUKE: You want a carrot?
LORELAI: Impossible.
LUKE: Right back at ya. So let me ask you something.
LORELAI: Napkin, please.
LUKE: Who did you want to get your basket?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: I mean, before you knew Patty was gonna put you on the Dating Game, you did pack this disgusting lunch and bring it out here, so who did you want to get it?
LORELAI: Well, last year Roy Wilkins bought it and I got my sprinklers fixed for half price.
LUKE: Uh huh.
LORELAI: And this year my rain gutters are completely clogged, and I thought if I could get the Collins kid to bite, I'd get that taken care of.
LUKE: Very practical.
LORELAI: I thought so.
LUKE: So the participation in this thing was purely for home improvement reasons?
LORELAI: Yes. And I don't know, it's a nice concept.
LUKE: What is?
LORELAI: Just having someone who you love or have some kind of crazy crush on bid on your basket and then share a romantic lunch, it's a nice concept.
LUKE: Well, I'm sure someday you'll manage to find the right guy and drag him out to this thing and make him by your stupid basket and then you'll be sitting out here with him.
LORELAI: Yeah, someday.
LUKE: You know what?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: This is nice.
[Dean walks up behind them]
DEAN: I have to talk to you.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, okay. I'll be right back.
LUKE: I'll be right here.
[Lorelai walks out of the gazebo over to Dean]
LORELAI: Hey, how're you doing?
DEAN: Uh, I'm not great.
LORELAI: Aw, Dean, it's just a silly town thing.
DEAN: I know, and I've been telling myself that and I tried to go home and forget about it, but I can't. I'm worried about Rory. I don't think she should be hanging out with this guy.
LORELAI: Well, I know that today was kind of a. . .
DEAN: It's got nothing to do with today. I mean, yes, it has a little to do with today but it's more than that. Ever since I've met him, I've had this feeling that he was bad news.
LORELAI: Yes, Jess has a few issues.
DEAN: Yeah, one issue is that he's a complete jerk. I mean, he's always getting in fights at school. That is, when he bothers to show up at all. And he's just. . . I don't know. And now this whole thing with Rory, it's like he's always around.
LORELAI: You sound jealous.
DEAN: I'm not jealous. He just. . . she has to be nice to everyone, you know?
LORELAI: I know. But hon, that's Rory.
DEAN: Well, he's gonna get her into trouble. I can feel it, I just know it. And he doesn't care about her, he's just using her to drive me crazy.
LORELAI: Dean, you love Rory, right?
DEAN: Yeah.
LORELAI: So, part of love is trust. You just have to trust her.
DEAN: I do trust her, it's - .
LORELAI: Him, I know. But flying off the handle like this is not gonna get you what you want. She cares about you, she's not gonna do anything to mess things up with you guys. I know this.
DEAN: I hope you're right.
[cut to Rory and Jess on the bridge]
RORY: Ten.
JESS: Ten?
RORY: Yeah but I didn't understand a word of it, so I had to reread it when I was fifteen.
JESS: I've yet to make it through it.
RORY: Really? Try it. The Fountainhead is classic.
JESS: Yeah, but Ayn Rand is a political nut.
RORY: Yeah, but nobody could write a forty page monologue the way that she could.
JESS: Okay, tomorrow I will try again, and you will. . .
RORY: Give the painful Ernest Hemingway another chance. Yes, I promise.
JESS: You know, Ernest only has lovely things to say about you.
RORY: Why are you only nice to me?
JESS: Excuse me?
RORY: An hour ago you were totally screwing with Dean and now you're totally nice to me.
JESS: You see, it's the screwing with Dean - that's an important step to getting here so that I can be nice to you.
RORY: So it was a plan.
JESS: What?
RORY: The whole bidding on my basket, it was a plan.
JESS: Okay, I'm officially starving.
RORY: And officially evasive.
JESS: Come on, I'll get you a pizza.
RORY: Answer my question.
JESS: Do you like pepperoni?
RORY: Not going to, are you?
JESS: We can just get it on half if you want.
RORY: Okay, I give, let's go.
JESS: If you insist.
[Rory walks away, not realizing her bracelet had fallen off. Jess picks it up and puts it in his pocket.]
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is sitting on the couch as Rory walks in the front door]
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: Oh, hey. Where've you been? I thought Taylor auctioned you off to the highest bidder.
RORY: No, I just went to get some pizza and I, uh, wandered around the bookstore for a little while. Here. [hands her a book]
LORELAI: What's this?
RORY: You said you wanted to read the Children's Hour.
LORELAI: I did?
RORY: The other night when we were watching Julia, and Jane Fonda was playing Lillian Hellman.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, and I made the Hellmann's mayonnaise joke.
RORY: Which no one ever needs to hear again.
LORELAI: Right, right. Well, thanks.
RORY: You're welcome.
LORELAI: So who were you with?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Pizza, book buying - did you have company?
RORY: Oh, yeah.
LORELAI: Who?
RORY: Um, Jess.
LORELAI: Jess?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Right.
RORY: So, I'll be in my room.
LORELAI: Okay, good.
[Lorelai follows Rory into her room]
LORELAI: So how was the picnic?
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Good. Did you get the Dean issue resolved?
RORY: Not yet. He's coming over later and we're gonna smooth things over hopefully.
LORELAI: Aw, yeah, well, smoothing's good. I love the smoothing. So, how was it with Jess?
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Well obviously, the pizza and the books. So good, that's. . .I'm glad.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: What what?
RORY: Well, you look like you have something to say.
LORELAI: I have nothing to say. I never have anything to say.
RORY: Yes, that is your reputation.
LORELAI: It's. . .I don't know. I'm just surprised that you're hanging out with him, that's all.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: He doesn't seem like the nicest kid.
RORY: Well, you don't know him.
LORELAI: No, I guess not.
RORY: You're just judging him by that one time that he came over here.
LORELAI: Which, by the way, was not a rousing success.
RORY: He had just moved here. He was mad at his mom. Trust me, he's got a really good side to him. You'll see it eventually.
LORELAI: Good, I can't wait.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: No, well, I'm sorry. It's. . I just, uh, I don't know. From the things I've seen and the things I hear. . .
RORY: Like what things?
LORELAI: The vandalism, the stealing, the cutting school, the fighting.
RORY: How do you know about the fighting?
LORELAI: Well, Dean told me.
RORY: Dean?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: You've been discussing this with Dean?
LORELAI: No, he discussed it with me.
RORY: When?
LORELAI: Today. Rory, he's really upset about this.
RORY: So he went running to my mother?
LORELAI: Well, he needed someone to talk to.
RORY: Well, he could've talked to me.
LORELAI: No, he couldn't cause you were off with Jess.
RORY: You're taking his side?
LORELAI: I'm not taking sides here, okay? I'm Swiss, babe.
RORY: I wasn't off with Jess. I. . .Jess outbid him.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Well, the rule is that if one person outbids someone else, then. . .
LORELAI: Rory, this is not about the rule. I know what the rule is. This is about Dean being concerned that you're hanging out with someone who can get you hurt.
RORY: How could Jess get me hurt?
LORELAI: I don't know, hon. In the short amount of time he's been here, he's managed to make a lot of enemies.
RORY: I'm sorry, when did I move to Salem?
LORELAI: People are concerned about you, you know? You're young and naïve and you think that everyone has some good inside if you give them a chance.
RORY: So you're saying that Jess is no good?
LORELAI: I've known guys like Jess. He seems cool because he's got this dangerous vibe and this problem with authority and he's seen a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies.
RORY: Oh my God.
LORELAI: But guys like this get into trouble which, if you hang out with them, gets you into trouble and I don't want you to get into trouble.
RORY: I'm sorry, are we talking about Dean still or are we suddenly talking about you?
LORELAI: Hey, I've been there, okay? You haven't.
RORY: Been where? I mean, we got pizza, we looked at some books. God, I can't even believe that I'm having this conversation with you. I mean, with you of all people. I mean. . . I don't even want to talk about this anymore.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: No, I'm going for a walk.
LORELAI: Uh, Dean is gonna be here any minute.
RORY: Well, he probably wants to talk to you anyhow.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner.]
EMILY: A cigar club. Can you imagine a more disgusting organization to join? Your grandfather now pays money to sit in an enclosed room with a bunch of other men and blow smoke in each other's faces. Twice a week he comes home smelling like a flophouse. So I finally just confronted him. I said, Richard, I know you're going through a transitional period here and I encourage your trying out new things, but this seems completely out of character for you.' I'm sorry, am I boring you?
LORELAI: No, you're not.
RORY: Sorry Grandma.
EMILY: So how are things at the inn?
LORELAI: Fine, the same.
EMILY: And Rory, how's that boyfriend of yours?
RORY: Apparently very chatty.
EMILY: Well that's nice. Lorelai, anything new with you?
LORELAI: No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet around the house lately.
EMILY: Well, sometimes quiet can be nice. Soothing. You can hear yourself think. All right, what's going on with you too?
LORELAI: Nothing.
EMILY: It's not nothing. You've both been sitting here all night, not saying a word and not even looking at each other. Are you in a fight?
LORELAI: I'm not.
RORY: Please.
LORELAI: Please what? You are the one who's been freezing me out all week.
RORY: I just haven't had anything to say. [her pager goes off]
LORELAI: Who is it?
RORY: No one.
LORELAI: Why won't you tell me who?
RORY: Cause it's no one.
LORELAI: Is it Jess?
RORY: You're kidding, right?
EMILY: Jess, who's Jess?
LORELAI: No, I'm not kidding.
RORY: Why would you automatically assume that it's Jess?
LORELAI: Because why won't you tell me who it is?
EMILY: Who's Jess?
LORELAI: Luke's nephew.
RORY: It's not Jess, okay? It's Dean. You wanna read it? Oh wait, no. Dean will probably tell you all about it later.
LORELAI: That's not funny. You know, all week you've been - .
RORY: We're not getting into this again.
EMILY: What? Getting into what? Is it about this Jess the thing you're not getting into again?
RORY: You know, you never liked Dean at the beginning.
LORELAI: That's because I didn't know him.
RORY: And now you don't like Jess?
LORELAI: That's because I know him.
EMILY: Are you dating Jess? What happened to Dean?
RORY: I'm not dating Jess.
LORELAI: No, but he's trying to weasel his way in.
RORY: He's not trying to weasel his way.
EMILY: In where?
LORELAI: In Rory's world. He has his eye on her, and he's trouble.
RORY: He's not trouble.
LORELAI: Yes he is.
EMILY: Rory, if your mother thinks this boy isn't appropriate company for you then you need to listen to her.
LORELAI: There, thank you Mom.
RORY: Excuse me, but I don't feel very hungry right now. [leaves table]
CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY
[Rory walks in and shuts the door. She sits down, then walks over to the phone and dials]
MRS. KIM: Kim's Antiques, we're closed, call tomorrow.
RORY: Mrs. Kim, it's Rory.
MRS. KIM: It's after nine.
RORY: I know.
MRS. KIM: Lane can't talk after nine.
RORY: Mrs. Kim, I promise I will never again call Lane after nine, but can I please just talk to her now? Just this once?
MRS. KIM: Okay, just this once.
RORY: Thank you.
[Mrs. Kim walks up to Lane's room]
MRS. KIM: Lane?
LANE: What?
MRS. KIM: Phone.
LANE: But it's after nine.
MRS. KIM: It's okay, it's Rory.
LANE: I don't want to talk right now.
MRS. KIM: Rory?
RORY: Yes?
MRS. KIM: Lane's not feeling well, she needs to call you tomorrow.
RORY: Oh, okay. Um, thanks anyhow.
MRS. KIM: Yes, goodbye. [hangs up] Lane!
[she walks into Lane's room]
MRS. KIM: It's early for you to be in bed.
LANE: I'm tired.
MRS. KIM: Come downstairs and have some tea.
LANE: No, thank you.
MRS. KIM: I know you're upset but I have these rules for a reason. I'm your mother, I know what's best for you.
LANE: Can we talk about this tomorrow please?
MRS. KIM: You see, this is exactly why I make these rules. You're too young, too vulnerable. American boys have different values, they don't understand respect, you get hurt. I do all of this so you don't get hurt and now here you are hurt. I don't like this, I don't like this at all. Who is he, this boy who hurt you?
LANE: Henry Cho.
MRS. KIM: Cho?
LANE: Yes.
MRS. KIM: Cho sounds Korean.
LANE: It is Korean.
MRS. KIM: He was Korean?
LANE: Yes, and he was smart and wonderful and cute.
MRS. KIM: And and you're sure he was Korean?
LANE: He's gonna be a doctor, he goes to church, he's a counselor at Bible camp, and he liked me.
MRS. KIM: A doctor.
LANE: I'm so stupid. I should've just told you and I didn't and now he's gone and I'm just stupid.
MRS. KIM: Maybe I can call his mother.
LANE: I don't want to talk about this anymore.
MRS. KIM: You're sure he was Korean?
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai and Emily sit at the table]
LORELAI: I swear Mom, there's just something about that kid that. . .ugh, I don't know. And I hate it because he's Luke's nephew and Rory likes him but. . .
EMILY: You are her mother Lorelai. You must set boundaries and restrictions, it's your job.
LORELAI: I wanted to like him but I just couldn't, and Rory can't see it.
EMILY: Well, she's young.
LORELAI: And she won't take my word for it.
EMILY: Well, she's young.
LORELAI: I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm overreacting.
EMILY: Lorelai, listen to me. Now I don't say this to you very often, but on this matter I happen to agree with you one hundred percent.
LORELAI: Gee, thanks Mom.
EMILY: I know Rory's a good girl, but good girls can go bad with the wrong influences. We all know that.
LORELAI: Oh no no, I don't think Rory's actually gonna go bad.
EMILY: Don't back down Lorelai. You took a stand and you are completely in the right here. You absolutely must keep her from that boy. If you need to change her curfew, lock her up, throw away the key, whatever it takes to make sure she doesn't go astray - you do it. Her judgment cannot be trusted here. She's a young girl and knows nothing. You are her eyes and her ears and her brain for as long as it takes to make sure she doesn't make any ridiculous choices in her life.
LORELAI: Yeah. Would you excuse me for a sec?
CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY
[Lorelai pushes open the door]
LORELAI: Hey, can I come in?
RORY: It's not my house, I can't stop you.
LORELAI: Just listen to me for one second okay? No sighing, just let me talk.
RORY: Go ahead.
LORELAI: I don't wanna lock you up and throw away the key.
RORY: Well good.
LORELAI: Your judgment means something, especially to me. I can't be your eyes and your ears and your brain.
RORY: I'm trying really hard to connect the dots here.
LORELAI: I got spooked. I know it violates the fabulous cool mom clause we're supposed to have going but I did and I'm sorry.
RORY: It's okay.
LORELAI: Now, I am concerned about Jess.
RORY: Well, you shouldn't be.
LORELAI: But I am. However, you are a smart girl, you're a good judge of character, and the fact that he seems to like you gives him a couple of brownie points. You're not a little kid. I don't actually think you ever were a little kid.
RORY: I was, for about a month.
LORELAI: If you think he's a decent guy, I have to respect your judgment.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: But I'm asking you to be careful.
RORY: I will.
LORELAI: Really careful.
RORY: I will.
LORELAI: Boy in the plastic bubble' kind of careful.
RORY: I promise.
LORELAI: And you have to cut Dean some slack. He's so crazy about you. He didn't mean anything by coming to me. He just wigged.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: So, fight over?
RORY: Fight over.
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: You still don't look okay.
LORELAI: Oh, well, my mother agreed with me tonight.
RORY: I'm so sorry.
LORELAI: Thank you, I appreciate that.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door.]
LORELAI: I need a shower.
RORY: Don't be so dramatic.
LORELAI: I agree with you a hundred percent.' Ugh!
RORY: Go upstairs.
LORELAI: Find a movie, I'll be down in a minute.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: I agree with you a hundred percent.' I may have to shave my head also.
RORY: Bye.
[Rory takes the phone into her room and dials a number]
JESS: Hello?
RORY: Hi.
JESS: Hi.
RORY: What are you doing?
JESS: Nothing, you?
RORY: Nothing.
JESS: Why'd you call?
RORY: I . . um, I wanted to. . .
JESS: I'm glad you called.
RORY: Yeah?
JESS: Yeah.
RORY: Why?
JESS: Because maybe you can explain what the hell this crazy woman is talking about.
RORY: Ah, The Fountainhead.
JESS: Yes. Your fault, and you will pay.
RORY: I promise. Commit to it one more time and if it still is awful for you, I will make it up to you.
JESS: Oh yeah?
RORY: Yeah.
JESS: Okay. I'm gonna hold you to that.

OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai and Rory are walking toward Luke's]
LORELAI: It still hurts.
RORY: Do you need stitches?
LORELAI: Probably.
RORY: Well, then we should go to a doctor.
LORELAI: No, no doctors. You go into a hospital, you don't come out again.
RORY: Well said, Ida Morgenstern.
LORELAI: I'm starving. I need pancakes.
RORY: Can I just ask .
LORELAI: No.
RORY: What on earth you thought you were doing?
LORELAI: I thought I was being a self-sufficient woman.
RORY: You hate ladders, you hate heights.
LORELAI: We needed our rain gutters cleaned.
RORY: Yeah, well, hire somebody.
LORELAI: Oh, well, aren't we suddenly a Rockefeller.
RORY: Well, it's better than you killing yourself.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic. It's what I do.
RORY: No more ladders.
LORELAI: I promise.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: I think I have gangrene.
RORY: You do not.
LORELAI: And vertigo.
RORY: Oh boy.
LORELAI: And one leg suddenly feels shorter than the other.
RORY: This is gonna be the Vanity Fair paper cut incident all over again, isn't it?
LORELAI: Wow!
RORY: Leave your bandage alone.
LORELAI: Look, it's turning purple, but a really glowy purple. Look!
RORY: No, thanks.
LORELAI: Hm. Maybe our rain gutters are radioactive or made out of some kind of alien metal so that when I cut my hand I got infected with an extraterrestrial substance which is altering my internal makeup. Ugh, maybe I'll turn into a superhero.
RORY: Maybe.
LORELAI: Like, maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and suddenly be able to shower really fast.
RORY: We'll go pick out your cape after breakfast.
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S
[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]
LORELAI: God, I'm starving. Must be from the loss of blood.
RORY: Yes, that must be it.
LORELAI: I'm getting pancakes with a side of pancakes. Where's Luke?
RORY: I don't know. Storage room?
LORELAI: Oh no.
RORY: Caesar's cooking.
LORELAI: Why is Caesar cooking?
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: That's bad.
RORY: His pancakes stink.
LORELAI: They do stink.
RORY: Well, what do we do? Resort to doughnuts.
LORELAI: Wait here.
[Lorelai walks over to the stairway to Luke's apartment]
CUT TO UPSTAIRS
[Lorelai knocks on Luke's apartment door]
LORELAI: Hey Luke, are you in there?
LUKE: Ow!
LORELAI: Luke, are you okay?
LUKE: Stupid box! Stupid lamp!
LORELAI: Hey Luke, are you being attacked by your possessions again?
[Luke opens the door]
LORELAI: Hi.
LUKE: Hi.
LORELAI: Whatcha doing?
LUKE: I'm looking for my supply ledger.
LORELAI: Is it going well?
LUKE: It's going fine.
LORELAI: You have a sock on your shoulder. Is it helping you look?
LUKE: What are you doing up here?
LORELAI: Rory and I are starving. We need you to cook us breakfast. [she walks into the apartment] Oh my God.
LUKE: Caesar can make you breakfast.
LORELAI: What happened to this place?
LUKE: Nothing.
LORELAI: This is what I always pictured the inside of my head to look like.
LUKE: See if you can find a brown leather ledger.
LORELAI: I've never seen so much stuff. It looks like a white trash Hearst Castle in here.
LUKE: On second thought, I'll find it myself.
LORELAI: Where'd all this come from?
LUKE: Jess. Liz shipped the rest of his stuff last week. He finally unpacked.
LORELAI: Well, he did a very nice job.
LUKE: I know it's crazy now, but I just have to get it all organized, figure out where to put everything, buy another dresser, a portable wardrobe, some storage bins.
LORELAI: Can of gasoline, box of matches.
LUKE: Did I mention that Caesar can cook you breakfast?
LORELAI: But he doesn't make the good fluffy pancakes like you do.
LUKE: Then order eggs.
LORELAI: No! See, I had a near death experience today.
LUKE: Really?
LORELAI: Yes. I almost fell off the roof of my house trying to clean the rain gutters, so I have to have pancakes. Please? I'll help you shower when I become a superhero.
[Jess walks out of the bathroom]
LUKE: You've been in there for two hours.
JESS: Yeah, well my hair just ain't bouncin' and behavin' today.
LUKE: There are other people living here too, you know.
JESS: Huh, learn something new everyday. [leaves]
LORELAI: Well, his people skills are really improving.
LUKE: Go downstairs. I'll be there as soon as I can.
LORELAI: How long is that?
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: An estimate.
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: Ballpark figure.
LUKE: I - .
LORELAI: Off the top of your head.
LUKE: Will you
LORELAI: Did I mention that I almost fell off my roof today?
LUKE: I'd lie down if I could find the bed.
[Lorelai sees the supply ledger and picks it up]
LORELAI: Oh, is this what you're looking for?
LUKE: Yes, great, thank you.
LORELAI: Not unless you make me the pancakes.
LUKE: Give me the book.
LORELAI: Give me the pancake!
LUKE: Come on.
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: You sure you weren't almost pushed off the roof of your house today?
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[That night, Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street]
LORELAI: Well, I think I'm finally ready to get a tattoo.
RORY: Oh please.
LORELAI: I am.
RORY: You've been saying that for the last five years.
LORELAI: I know, but I mean it this time.
RORY: Fine, what are you getting?
LORELAI: Mel Brooks.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: What do you mean, why? The Two Thousand Year Old Man, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie you don't think Mel has earned the right to have his face on my butt?
RORY: I am so sorry, Mel.
LORELAI: Oh, he'll love it, trust me. So, rocky road hot fudge sundaes and two cans of whipped cream to go with the movies?
RORY: Trying to give Mel a bigger canvas to work with?
LORELAI: Hey, the man's a legend, he deserves the best.
[As they pass the diner, Lorelai notices Luke inside sitting at a table]
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Luke.
RORY: What's he doing?
LORELAI: I'm not sure. Hey, will you go get the ice cream and make sure they give us a ton of maraschino cherries?
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Thanks.
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S
[Luke is sitting at a table watching a very small television set as Lorelai knocks on the door]
LORELAI: Hey
LUKE: Hey, what are you doing?
LORELAI: Oh, uh, Rory and I just hit the video store. Now we're on our way home to eat a large amount of something you would not approve of.
LUKE: Sounds good.
LORELAI: What are you doing?
LUKE: Oh, watching TV.
LORELAI: Ah. Wow, that's cute. Is this the first time it's been away from its mother?
LUKE: It's a very good TV.
LORELAI: Hm, black and white, coat hanger antenna, really bad reception.
LUKE: It's fine.
LORELAI: Don't you have a fully grown TV upstairs?
LUKE: Yeah, well, Jess is upstairs.
LORELAI: So?
LUKE: So when Jess is upstairs, that means the stereo's blaring and the place is a mess. I just needed a little privacy.
LORELAI: So you came downstairs.
LUKE: Yes.
LORELAI: To sit on an uncomfortable chair in an empty diner that smells like onion rings.
LUKE: Yes.
LORELAI: Calgon, take me away.
LUKE: It was very peaceful until two minutes ago.
LORELAI: Hey Luke, do you ever think that, uh, maybe you should get a bigger apartment?
LUKE: I don't need a bigger apartment.
LORELAI: That place upstairs was your father's office. You turned it into an apartment. It was never meant to be lived in.
LUKE: It's fine.
LORELAI: It's too small for two people. It's too small for one person if they have any kind of life.
LUKE: We'll make due, we just need to organize.
LORELAI: No, you don't need to organize. You need to move.
LUKE: I like my apartment.
LORELAI: It's not just your apartment. Jess lives there also.
LUKE: Jess is fine.
LORELAI: Are you sure? Because he could be pinned down under a box for a year in that place and you wouldn't know it until the neighbors started to complain about the smell.
[Rory walks in]
RORY: Hey Luke.
LUKE: Rory, perfect, get her out of here. Go.
LORELAI: But, uh, okay, fine. I'm leaving. Think about what I said.
LUKE: Oh, hey, did you ever hire anybody to do that work for you?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: The rain gutters.
LORELAI: Oh, no, not yet. Are you offering?
LUKE: No, actually, I was thinking about Jess.
LORELAI: Uh, Jess?
LUKE: Yeah, he's always looking for a little extra cash. He doesn't make that much here, and, you know, I hate to think of where else he might try to get it, so
LORELAI: Huh.
LUKE: I mean, you don't have to pay him the same as would someone else, and you save a little, he keeps busy.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, maybe. Um, I actually have to check with a couple of people I'm supposed to hear from, but if they can't do it, then sure.
LUKE: Great, just let me know.
LORELAI: I will. Bye.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the diner]
RORY: So who are all these people you asked to clean out our gutters?
LORELAI: Oh, well, you know.
RORY: I do?
LORELAI: Sh-yeah.
RORY: Remind me.
LORELAI: Okay, well, there's Sid.
RORY: Oh, Sid, right.
LORELAI: And then there's Lou.
RORY: Yeah, a good man, Lou.
LORELAI: Oh, and also Moose. That is, if Doris will let him out of the house again, you know, after that incident at Chicky's bachelor party.
RORY: I thought you said you were gonna give Jess a chance.
LORELAI: I am.
RORY: Then why don't you hire him?
LORELAI: I'm just not very comfortable with him, Rory.
RORY: Well, try and get comfortable.
LORELAI: Well, I don't know if I can.
RORY: But you said - .
LORELAI: I know what I said, but I can't help it.
RORY: How many times do I have to tell you .
LORELAI: That I don't know the real Jess?
RORY: You don't.
LORELAI: Well, fine, I don't know him, but I'm not too fond of his stand in.
RORY: People are different once you get to know them. If you'll remember, you weren't too fond of Luke when you first met him.
LORELAI: That's not true.
RORY: You called him Duke for two years just to make him mad.
LORELAI: And let me tell you, it worked.
RORY: But then you guys talked and eventually, time went by, and now you love him.
LORELAI: Well. . .
RORY: I'm just asking you to give Jess that same chance.
LORELAI: Rory, you like him. I don't have to like him.
RORY: Please?
LORELAI: Can I at least call him Tess for a little while?
RORY: You'll give him the job?
LORELAI: I'll give him the job.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome. Tell me something.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Why is it so important to you that I like him?
RORY: Well, I just think that he's Luke's nephew and we like Luke and we eat at Luke's everyday, and we see Jess when we eat there everyday, and that it just might make things nicer if you liked him.
LORELAI: And that's the only reason?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: It's all about Luke and the diner?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: It has nothing to do with you?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: So you and Jess aren't friends?
RORY: Well, yeah, we're friends.
LORELAI: Uh huh.
RORY: I mean, we're not good friends but we're friends. We're friendly. But that doesn't mean that we're friends in the traditional Webster's dictionary definition of friends.
LORELAI: Right.
RORY: Friendish might be a better term.
LORELAI: Okay, friendish. Got it.
[They pass by a group of walkers that Miss Patty is instructing from a golf cart.]
MISS PATTY: And walk, and walk, and pump your arms and walk. And shoulders back, tucus in, think about that double chin and walk and walk and walk and tummies tight and walk. Match me sweetheart.
CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke walks in, Jess is asleep, music is blaring.]
LUKE: Jess? [Luke turns the music off] How can anyone sleep through that? It's like the Huns are attacking and you're just well, you're oblivious and that's why you can just lie there while the rest of the world is going - . [he knocks over his little television] Great! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!
JESS: Whoa, geez, what the hell?
LUKE: I can't stand it, I'm going crazy. This place is awful. I can't live like this anymore.
JESS: Just relax.
LUKE: I can't relax. I can't sleep. I'm having nightmares about being chased around by boxes with arms and they tackle me and pile clothing on top of my face and secure it around my head with packing tape and I'm just lying there choking while you're sitting in the corner laughing, putting gel in your hair with a switchblade!
JESS: Should I be putting a tongue depressor in your mouth right about now?
LUKE: We're moving.
JESS: What?
LUKE: Tomorrow.
JESS: What are you talking about?
LUKE: I'm talking about you and me going out, getting a paper, and finding a new place to live.
JESS: But I .
LUKE: No buts. Ten o'clock tomorrow morning I want you up, washed, moussed, and ready to leave, end of story. Now go back to bed. What?
JESS: I need the music on to sleep.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[The next day, Luke and Jess walk out of an apartment building]
JESS: Forget it.
LUKE: Why, what was wrong with that one?
JESS: It was pink.
LUKE: We can paint it.
JESS: You mean I can paint it.
LUKE: We can paint it together.
JESS: Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards.
LUKE: Fine, which one do you like?
JESS: The one before.
LUKE: The one with the two fridges?
JESS: No.
LUKE: Well, the one before was the one with two fridges.
JESS: No, the one we saw before was the one with the cat.
LUKE: I hate cats.
JESS: Well, I don't think the cat came with the place.
LUKE: Yeah, but it had carpeting which means it's always gonna smell like a cat.
JESS: Clean the carpet.
LUKE: Paint the pink.
JESS: Fine, the one next to the bank.
LUKE: Too many windows.
JESS: What?
LUKE: Six windows all on one side, three o'clock in the afternoon we're sitting in an oven.
JESS: So we get curtains.
LUKE: Well, you'll have to help me put them up.
JESS: Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards.
LUKE: Stop saying that.
JESS: You know what, I don't care. Pick whichever one you want.
LUKE: I'm not picking by myself.
JESS: You're the one who wants to move.
LUKE: Oh, so you like living the way we do?
JESS: Fine by me.
LUKE: No space, no privacy.
JESS: I got plenty of privacy.
LUKE: Yeah, because I'm sitting downstairs in the dark watching a two-inch V.
JESS: Hey, you're the one with the problem, you make the choice.
LUKE: Jess, come on.
JESS: I have to go.
LUKE: We got three more places to look at.
JESS: I'm supposed to be at Lorelai's in twenty minutes, remember?
LUKE: Oh, yeah.
JESS: I mean, if you want me to bail on her, fine.
LUKE: Nah, you go. I'll look at the places all alone.
JESS: Great idea.
LUKE: I'll take some Polaroids and you can take a look at them later.
JESS: Take a Polaroid, paint a still picture, whatever you want.
LUKE: Jess, come on.
JESS: Hey, nobody asked me if I wanted to move to Stars Hollow, but I'm here. Pick whatever place you want and I'll be there too.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is sitting on the couch as Rory walks through the front door]
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: Come here, come here, come here.
RORY: I'm here, what's the matter?
LORELAI: Sit, sit, sit. Okay, that should do it.
RORY: Do what?
LORELAI: Wait.
RORY: What are we waiting for?
LORELAI: Patience, grasshopper.
RORY: Are we close?
LORELAI: Very close. Hm, getting closer.
RORY: Should I get chips?
LORELAI: Ready, and .
[They stare at a digital clock. When it changes, the clock starts making pig noises.]
RORY: The clock is grunting.
LORELAI: This, my friend, is a state of the art CD/clock radio that enables you to wake up to the barnyard animal of your choice.
RORY: That is great.
LORELAI: I have selected the perky piggies. You might choose the cheery chickens or the goofy goats.
RORY: That is closest to a farm that I ever wanna get.
LORELAI: Amen, sister friend.
[There's a knock at the front door]
RORY: I'll get it. [answers the door] Hey.
JESS: Here. [tosses her a CD]
RORY: The Shaggs?
JESS: Trust me
RORY: Okay. So you're very punctual.
JESS: Yeah, well, it was this or continue apartment hunting with Luke.
RORY: You're moving?
JESS: I don't know. Luke flipped out last night and next thing I know, he's dragging me all over town banging on pipes and measuring square footage. It's crazy.
RORY: A new place might be nice. More space, maybe you'll get your own room.
JESS: You change your hair?
RORY: What?
JESS: Your hair looks different.
RORY: So, segue's not your thing, huh?
JESS: Is it?
RORY: Well, um, no, I wear it like this a lot. Why?
JESS: Just looks different.
RORY: Oh, bad different?
LORELAI: [from living room] Hey, ducks!
RORY: We just got a new alarm clock.
JESS: Huh. Bet I know what the lead story in the Stars Hollow Gazette's gonna be tomorrow.
[Lorelai walks to the front door]
LORELAI: Hey, did you hear the ducks cause they're great. Oh Jess, you're here, terrific.
RORY: So, um, would you like to come in?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, come on in. Sorry, it's just. . .so excited about the ducks that, uh. . .do you want something to drink? You have good timing cause we shopped yesterday, and in addition to a case of Maybelline Fresh Lash Mascara, I also bought some of that new, uh, freaky Coke with the lemon in it. It's very addictive.
RORY: You can sit, you know.
JESS: No thanks.
LORELAI: So, Jess, what's new?
JESS: Not much.
RORY: Jess and Luke are looking for an apartment.
LORELAI: Oh, you guys see anything good yet?
JESS: Nope.
LORELAI: Well, you know, there's some really cool places over on Peach. Or on Plum. Hm, Orange. Basically, any of your fruit named streets are pretty nice. Okay, well, I guess you should get started. Um, there's a ladder right out front and some buckets and gloves and stuff on the porch. You need anything else, just walk against the wind.
RORY: Come on, I'll show you.
[Jess walks out the door]
LORELAI: I'm trying.
RORY: Well, keep it up.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Rory walks out of the house and over to Jess]
RORY: Question.
JESS: Yes?
RORY: You come over. You seem to have a very firm grasp of the English language. You put together several full sentences, even using a couple of words that contain two or more syllables, and then my mother appears and suddenly we need a thought bubble over your head to understand what you're thinking. Can you tell me why that is?
JESS: The verbal thing comes and goes.
RORY: I would really appreciate it if you would try to get along with my mom.
JESS: I took the Coke.
RORY: I know.
JESS: Personally, I think it's a little crazy to put lemon in Coke but I took it anyhow.
RORY: Stop it.
JESS: Ooh, stern face.
RORY: Look, I went out on a limb for you trying to get my mom to give you the benefit of the doubt, okay? So I don't think it would hurt you to try to be nice.
JESS: Why?
RORY: Why?
JESS: Yeah, why?
RORY: Because she's my mom and she's a friend of Luke's.
JESS: So?
RORY: What do you mean, so?
JESS: So just because she's your mom or Luke's friend doesn't mean that I automatically have to get along with her.
RORY: Jess, my mother is a great person. She's also my best friend in the world, so if you care about me at all, you will take that into consideration and you will be mildly polite to her.
JESS: What makes you think I care about you?
RORY: I don't mean care care, like care. I mean if you like me at all. . . not like like. I just meant that if. . . if you think of me remotely as the sort of person that you could occasionally stand to talk to then you will try to get along with my mom, that's all.
JESS: Okay.
RORY: Okay?
JESS: I can't guarantee that it'll work, but I'll try.
RORY: Thank you.
JESS: You're welcome. I should probably get to work.
RORY: Right. Sorry, go ahead.
CUT TO FRONT OF STARS HOLLOW LIBRARY
[Several tables and racks of books are set up for the Buy a Book Fundraiser. Dean is sitting on the steps of the library as Rory walks over with some books.]
RORY: Inherit the Wind, seventy-five cents.
DEAN: Great.
RORY: Now, here's a copy of Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet which I already have, but in hardback. This is a paperback fits perfectly in a coat pocket and it's only a dollar. I'm torn. Opinions?
DEAN: Get it.
RORY: You look bored.
DEAN: I'm fine.
RORY: You sure you don't wanna look around? They have great stuff here.
DEAN: I looked.
RORY: For five minutes.
DEAN: No, I looked for twenty minutes and then I stopped and you continued for another two hours.
RORY: It has not been that long. Oh, sorry.
DEAN: No big deal.
RORY: Let's go.
DEAN: Are you done?
RORY: Yup, I've looked enough.
DEAN: You're not done.
RORY: No, I'm fine, really. Let's go.
DEAN: Rory, stop it. You wanna keep looking, I know you.
RORY: No, I wanna hang out with you.
DEAN: Are you sure?
RORY: Yes, I'll just pay for these and then we can go.
DEAN: I thought maybe we can go see The Lord of the Rings again.
RORY: Oh, okay.
DEAN: What?
RORY: Nothing.
DEAN: Well, I thought you loved The Lord of the Rings.
RORY: I do.
DEAN: You said you wanted to see it a hundred times.
RORY: Yes, and apparently we're being very literal these days.
DEAN: Fine, we'll see something else.
RORY: Lord of the Rings is fine. Can you help me with these?
[They walk to the cash register]
KIRK: I'll give you fifty-five cents.
GYPSY: It's sixty-five.
KIRK: Fifty-five cents.
GYPSY: Kirk, it's for charity. There's no haggling.
KIRK: Oh no, there's always haggling. Sixty cents.
GYPSY: No.
KIRK: That's my final offer.
GYPSY: I'm sorry, I can't.
KIRK: Fine.
GYPSY: Kirk, come on.
KIRK: No.
GYPSY: Cough up another nickel.
KIRK: Forget it it's the principal of the thing. [walks away]
GYPSY: Wow, you made out like a bandit.
RORY: Well, you've got great stuff this year.
GYPSY: Hey, did you see the astronomy section over there?
RORY: Oh, yeah.
GYPSY: Didn't find anything?
RORY: Nope.
DEAN: Wait, I didn't see you look over there.
RORY: Well, I did.
DEAN: Go look.
RORY: I told you I'm done.
DEAN: Hey, where. . . where's your bracelet?
RORY: What?
DEAN: You're not wearing your bracelet.
RORY: Oh.
DEAN: Where is it?
RORY: I took it off.
DEAN: Why?
RORY: Well, because I got this weird rash on my wrist.
DEAN: From the bracelet?
RORY: Oh no, just a fluke thing. Actually, I think my Spanish midterm gave it to me.
DEAN: Oh.
RORY: But it's getting better it's almost gone.
DEAN: Well, good.
RORY: And as soon as it's completely gone, that bracelet goes right back on.
DEAN: So, uh, compromise.
RORY: What?
DEAN: You go look at the astronomy section, we'll go see Lord of the Rings, and on the way home we'll rent Autumn in New York and mock it for the rest of the afternoon.
RORY: With full-on impressions?
DEAN: With full-on impressions.
RORY: Deal.
DEAN: Go, I'll wait here. Smiling, not at all bored.
KIRK: Sixty-two cents.
GYPSY: Get out of here Kirk.
KIRK: Damn.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai walks into the kitchen, takes several containers of Chinese food out of the refrigerator, then walks outside.]
LORELAI: Jess? Hey, Jess!
JESS: Sorry, too loud?
LORELAI: Oh, no, it's fine. Uh, it's just. . . I got a ton of leftover Chinese food in the kitchen. I thought you might like some lunch.
JESS: No thanks.
LORELAI: Okay.
JESS: Chinese sounds great.
LORELAI: Really?
JESS: If you're sure you have enough.
LORELAI: There's plenty. Rory and I decided to take on the entire chicken column last night.
JESS: Ambitious.
LORELAI: Well, it's all out on the table, so come in when you're ready.
JESS: I'm ready now.
LORELAI: Okay, then I'll see you inside.
CUT TO KITCHEN
LORELAI: So, um, basically everything here is chicken. You've got garlic chicken, Kung Pao chicken, Szechuan Chicken, chicken in brown sauce, which looks and tastes remarkably like the Szechuan Chicken except it's got these red peppers in it and if you eat them, you die. Plate?
JESS: I thought I'd, uh. . .
LORELAI: Oh, soap's on the counter.
JESS: So when was the last time you had those gutters cleaned?
LORELAI: It's been awhile.
JESS: Yeah, I found an I like Ike' bumper sticker up there.
LORELAI: Is it really bad?
JESS: Well, it won't be by tomorrow.
LORELAI: I like hearing that.
JESS: So you guys aren't too hot on vegetables, huh?
LORELAI: What are you talking about? There's green pepper in the Kung Pao.
JESS: My mistake.
LORELAI: So, are you a healthy eater like Luke?
JESS: No. No one's a healthy eater like Luke. Yule Gibbons wasn't a healthy eater like Luke.
LORELAI: Wow, it's been ages since I've heard a good Yule Gibbons reference.
JESS: Many parts of a pine tree are edible.
LORELAI: That's right. God, I wonder what the research process was like to get that information.
JESS: I'd say fairly painful.
LORELAI: Huh. Here. So how's school?
JESS: It's still there.
LORELAI: You on any teams or anything?
JESS: No, no, no.
LORELAI: Not a jersey guy?
JESS: No, definitely not a jersey guy. Though the thought of throwing a ball at some jock's head isn't entirely unappealing. Look, I'm not really good at this small talk thing.
LORELAI: You're doing okay. Cold egg roll?
JESS: Why not? [takes a bite]
LORELAI: Bad?
JESS: Oh yeah.
[the front door slams and Rory yells from off camera]
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Here right here! What?
RORY: Mom!
[cut to front entryway; Rory is looking through all the coat pockets as Lorelai walks over]
LORELAI: What's going on?
RORY: I don't know where it is!
LORELAI: Where what is?
RORY: My bracelet it's gone.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
RORY: How could I do this? How could I lose that bracelet?
[Rory starts looking in the living room]
LORELAI: Honey, tell me which bracelet maybe I stole it from you.
RORY: Dean's bracelet.
LORELAI: The one he made you?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: It's gone?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Where?
RORY: I don't know where. If I knew where then I would have it.
LORELAI: Well, when did you first notice it was gone?
RORY: When he pointed out that I wasn't wearing it.
LORELAI: Oh, not good. What did you say?
RORY: That I had a rash and that I had to take it off until it healed.
LORELAI: Nice save, Gretzky.
RORY: It's not here, it's not here. God.
LORELAI: Okay, let's retrace your steps. When was the last time you remember wearing it?
RORY: Um, I don't know.
LORELAI: Think hard yesterday?
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: The day before?
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: The day before that?
RORY: Um, yeah.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: No, I don't remember. I can't remember. Help me move the couch.
LORELAI: What about your locker at school?
RORY: I don't know why it would be there, I never take it off at school. I never take it off at all.
LORELAI: Anything?
RORY: Just Grandma's pen.
LORELAI: Leave it there.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: It makes life fun
RORY: I'm gonna freak out now.
LORELAI: We'll find it.
RORY: I'm gonna have to tell Dean that I lost his bracelet.
LORELAI: Let's not even go there yet.
RORY: He made it for me.
LORELAI: He'll make you another one.
RORY: But he's gonna be mad.
LORELAI: He'll understand.
RORY: How do you know?
LORELAI: I'm looking at the track record and all signs point to he'll understand. Did you look in your room?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: All right, I'll check the car. And don't worry if worse comes to worse and we can't find it, we'll follow Dean to work, hide behind the cantaloupes, jump him, blind him and he'll never find out.
RORY: As long as we have a plan.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Michel is standing at the front desk; Lorelai is on the floor behind the desk]
MICHEL: Who is Randy Mill?
LORELAI: Ugh, let me see. Maintenance.
MICHEL: Are you going to be down there long?
LORELAI: Uh, I just wanna to make sure Rory's bracelet didn't get kicked back behind something.
MICHEL: Hmm, and so earlier when you told me to look for the bracelet and I told you I did look and I did not find it, you
LORELAI: Just decided to double check.
MICHEL: Yes, though another theory is that you did not believe me.
LORELAI: I did too.
MICHEL: No, I believe you thought I was lying. That I did not actually get down on my hands and knees in a brand new Donna Karan suit and crawl around on a floor where people who have stepped in mud and garbage and animal waste have been traipsing all day long.
LORELAI: It's not there.
MICHEL: No? Why, I'm shocked.
LORELAI: Okay, I'm sorry I doubted you, Michel.
MICHEL: Well, that means a lot, thank you.
LORELAI: We turned the house upside down. Rory's having a heart attack. It's just awful.
MICHEL: Yes, well, as soon as my dry cleaning bill is paid for, you will have my sympathies.
LORELAI: I will pay for your suit, Michel.
MICHEL: Mm hmm.
[phone rings]
MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Hold on please. [to Lorelai] It's for you.
LORELAI: Lorelai here.
LUKE: I don't want a wood-burning fireplace.
LORELAI: Luke?
LUKE: But if I take an apartment with a wood-burning fireplace, even though I could give a rat's ass about a wood-burning fireplace, I have to pay an extra two hundred dollars a month for the wood-burning fireplace.
LORELAI: Yeah, but - .
LUKE: And three of the places make you put down a five hundred dollar deposit if you have a dog. Can you believe this?
LORELAI: You don't have a dog.
LUKE: I know, but it's wrong.
LORELAI: Agreed. What else?
LUKE: Parking.
LORELAI: Ah.
LUKE: How can people ask you for a monthly fee for a parking space? I mean, they're making money off your rent, off your utilities, when you use their coin-operated washer and dryer that's cash directly in their pocket. And by the way, it's not even that good a parking space. It's out in the open under one of those trees that drops the sap on your car that eats away your paint.
LORELAI: Luke?
LUKE: Who's gonna pay for my car, huh? Where's my five hundred dollar, paint-killing tree sap deposit?
LORELAI: You haven't found a place yet?
LUKE: And I've been looking all day.
LORELAI: There wasn't one place you liked?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Not one place that gave you a little feeling of, Huh, well that has a nice vibe about it.'
LUKE: I don't use the word vibe.
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: Maybe one place wasn't so bad.
LORELAI: Oh good, describe it to me.
LUKE: I don't know. It had walls with a kind of a floor with a light.
LORELAI: Okay, hold on here, mister. If you tell me it's got a roof, I'm stealing that baby out from under you.
LUKE: I just can't tell anymore. I need a second opinion.
LORELAI: Do you want me to come look at your apartment?
LUKE: It's not my apartment, and yes.
LORELAI: Done.
LUKE: Now.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Please?
LORELAI: Uh, well -.
LUKE: I promised the woman I'd give her an answer today.
LORELAI: Okay, give me the address.
LUKE: Sixty-two and a half B Street. And that's another thing what's with this half business? Why do all these apartments have this half thing going? It's stupid. If sixty-two is taken, move on to sixty-three.
LORELAI: Luke, I'll meet you there in twenty and a half minutes.
LUKE: Thank you.
LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up] Michel, I have to go out for a little while. Cover the desk for me.
MICHEL: Mm hmm.
LORELAI: What?
MICHEL: Well, I mean, I'll say I'll cover the desk, but how will you know if I'm actually doing it?
LORELAI: I trust you, Michel.
MICHEL: I mean, it's just as possible I say I'll cover the desk, and the moment you've stepped away I'll put some fruit on my head and join a conga line somewhere.
LORELAI: I believe you looked for the bracelet.
MICHEL: And while I'm shaking it to the Miami Sound Machine, the phones here they would ring and ring and ring, and no one to answer, no one to assist.
LORELAI: Okay, bye Mom.
CUT TO APARTMENT BUILDING
[The real estate agent leads Luke and Lorelai through the apartment]
MARY: It's a very quiet street and the owner keeps the building up beautifully. He hasn't remodeled it at all. Plus, I bet he could be persuaded to give the floor a little spruce if you like.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, we'd like a spruce.
LUKE: A spruce is unnecessary.
LORELAI: Hey, you never turn down a spruce.
MARY: She's right listen to her.
LORELAI: Yeah, listen to me.
LUKE: You rarely give me a choice.
LORELAI: Come here so I can lick your face.
LUKE: What?
MARY: Now, I went over the square footage and the details of the lease with your husband this morning. Did he fill you in?
LUKE: What? Oh no, we're .
LORELAI: No, no, he didn't, but you know how men are. The minute that ball game comes on, all the realities of life just go right out the window.
MARY: Don't I know it.
LORELAI: I mean, I could answer the door wrapped in cellophane but unless I was wearing a Yankees cap. . .ugh, he wouldn't even notice.
LUKE: Geez.
LORELAI: Oh, don't be embarrassed Snuffy, I'm just teasing. It'd be a Mets cap.
LUKE: Hey Mary, could you possibly leave me and little missus alone for just a minute?
MARY: Why, of course.
LORELAI: I promise we won't do anything dirty.
MARY: Oh please, if my husband and I looked anything like the two of you, we'd never get dressed.
LORELAI: Oh, you are bad!
MARY: Let me just leave this rental agreement with you in case you decide to fill it out.
LUKE: Thanks.
MARY: Oh, I hope you take it. It's got a great vibe for a nice couple like you two. [leaves]
LORELAI: Oh, thirteen different shades of red!
LUKE: What is wrong with you?
LORELAI: You make it too easy.
LUKE: By standing here?
LORELAI: Oh, relax Snuffy. Let's talk. What do you think?
LUKE: She used the word vibe.
LORELAI: About the apartment.
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: Okay then, break it down. List your concerns.
LUKE: Well, it's too big.
LORELAI: It's not too big. Next.
LUKE: I don't need two bathrooms.
LORELAI: Yes, you do. Next.
LUKE: I like being on the bottom floor.
LORELAI: The top floor's quieter. Next.
LUKE: You know, somehow I think this would be easier if you just listed your concerns first.
LORELAI: Okay. Um. . .I don't have any. I think it's great.
LUKE: You do?
LORELAI: Yeah, it's light and airy. It's got good windows but not too many so that the sun bakes you in the afternoon.
LUKE: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're close to work, the price seems good, you're taking the spruce, and it's a two-year lease. What's two years?
LUKE: I don't know. I - .
LORELAI: Luke, you need to do this. You and Jess will k*ll each other if you stay in that place of yours.
LUKE: Yeah, but who knows how long he's gonna be here.
LORELAI: Why? Did something happen?
LUKE: No, but you never know.
LORELAI: No, you don't, but I think his mom sending his stuff is a pretty good sign.
LUKE: And even if he does stay, it'll be only for another year, and then he'll go off to college or Attica or whatever, and it'll just be me again.
LORELAI: Yeah, but - .
LUKE: And stuck with a new apartment, probably with neighbors I hate who are constantly cooking really strong smelling food.
LORELAI: Okay, back up here. Yes, Jess may go off somewhere someday, but that doesn't mean you will be alone forever.
LUKE: I am not getting a pet.
LORELAI: I'm talking about a lady friend.
LUKE: Oh.
LORELAI: A red-hot mama.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: A big, pretty dish of lovin' with a spoon made especially for you.
LUKE: Boy, do I not feel good now.
LORELAI: Luke, Rachel's not the only woman in the world for you. You'll meet someone, someday -- probably at a Timberland store, you'll ask her out. You'll pick her up and take her on a patented Luke Danes night of romance -- juice bar followed by the batting cages -- and then you'll ask her back to your apartment.
LUKE: Any amount of money if you stop right now.
LORELAI: You'll bring her back to your place, lead her upstairs to the apartment door. You pause, gaze into her eyes the stage is set, fate is waiting. You open the door, and she sees your teeny, tiny apartment one room and no closet space and Jess' feet sticking up in the air cause you never did get rid of that body!
LUKE: Stop, please.
LORELAI: And to make matters worse, she spots it: the single bed.
LUKE: What's wrong with a single bed?
LORELAI: You know what they say.
LUKE: No, what do they say?
LORELAI: Never, ever date a guy who owns a single bed. It means he's not open to a commitment.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: It says there's no room in this life for anybody but me.
LUKE: No, it says there's no room in this bed for anyone but me.
LORELAI: Okay, see, that's not a whole lot better.
LUKE: This discussion is now over.
LORELAI: Luke, as long as you're in that apartment, you're gonna have a single bed. Don't you want the possibility of more? Come on Luke, it's time. Make a move, take a shot, entertain the possibility of a non-unabomber existence. What do you say?
LUKE: You got a pen? I'm not taking the spruce.
LORELAI: Yes, you are.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai arrives home and walks into the kitchen as Jess walks out of Rory's room]
LORELAI: Hey.
JESS: Hey.
LORELAI: Did you get lost?
JESS: No, I was looking at Rory's books.
LORELAI: Uh huh.
JESS: I wanted to see if she had Franny and Zooey. She does.
LORELAI: Okay.
JESS: I was gonna get it for her if she didn't.
LORELAI: That's very nice of you.
JESS: Yeah. Okay, so I should probably get back to work.
LORELAI: Mm hmm.
CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET
[Luke is shopping as Taylor walks up to him]
TAYLOR: Luke, good good goody good good. I was just on my way over to the diner to talk to you.
LUKE: Great. Go on over, I'll meet you there.
TAYLOR: Oh, stop it, this isn't about anything that's gonna make you mad. I just have a couple of questions about your application.
LUKE: What?
TAYLOR: Your application. Now I called your bank - .
LUKE: What application?
TAYLOR: Your application for the apartment. Now you have two accounts here -.
LUKE: How did you get my application?
TAYLOR: Well, Mary gave it to me, of course. Now I'm assuming that one of those accounts -.
LUKE: Why would Mary give you my application?
TAYLOR: Because I own the building.
LUKE: What? When the hell did you buy an apartment building?
TAYLOR: Well, I bought this particular one about two months ago.
LUKE: I look at a thousand apartments, I choose yours. How is that possible?
TAYLOR: Well, count yourself lucky, you. With me as the owner, there is a level of quality control that is sorely lacking in this town. For example, at all my properties, we measure the grass before, during, and after mowing to attain a perfect inch and a half height, which is both pleasing to the eye and good for the grass.
LUKE: All of your properties?
TAYLOR: Ten in all.
LUKE: Ten properties? What are you, buying up the town?
TAYLOR: Not yet, but someday who knows?
LUKE: But why isn't anyone stopping you?
TAYLOR: Because, my friend, people are lazy. They don't wanna think about the proper fabric for an awning or the correct historical color for a building. They just slap any old thing up on a wall and sleep like babies. But soon, hopefully, the city council will put an end to that.
LUKE: Taylor, you cannot tell people what color to paint their buildings!
TAYLOR: Well, someone has to.
LUKE: No, they don't. We don't live in a fascist country.
TAYLOR: Oh, this isn't about the fascists who, by the way, had their faults but their parks were spotless.
LUKE: I have to get out of here. [leaves]
TAYLOR: Hey, eh, wait a minute.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Taylor follows Luke down the sidewalk]
TAYLOR: Luke, hold it! I still need to talk to you.
LUKE: Just tear up the application, Taylor. I'm not moving.
TAYLOR: What? Why?
LUKE: Cause I'm the two-inch grass kind of guy.
TAYLOR: Well, that's too bad but I need to talk to you about something else.
LUKE: What?
TAYLOR: I'm thinking about purchasing the flower shop next to the diner, but we need to talk about that sign of yours.
LUKE: What about my sign?
TAYLOR: Well, you have a diner but you never took down the Williams' Hardware sign.
LUKE: That was my father's sign.
TAYLOR: I understand that you have a sentimental attachment to the sign, but it confuses the tourists.
LUKE: Back off the sign, Taylor.
TAYLOR: If I buy the building next to that sign, I run the risk of people being so busy trying to figure out if you sell hammers or burgers, that they never notice the nice collectible plate store right next door.
LUKE: Collectible plates?
TAYLOR: Isn't that a great idea? Elvis, The Beatles, Mary Poppins, all the greats. You can hang them on the wall or you buy a little stand and set them up on the coffee table.
LUKE: Okay, you need to get away from me now. At least a good arm swinging length away.
TAYLOR: It's people like you who keep this town from becoming one of great towns in America, Luke.
LUKE: Arm swinging length!
TAYLOR: I wouldn't have approved your application anyway.
CUT TO OUTSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Jess climbs down the ladder as Rory comes home and sits on the porch]
JESS: You look good.
RORY: I'm fine.
JESS: Talk.
RORY: I lost my bracelet.
JESS: Uh huh.
RORY: Dean gave it to me.
JESS: How thoughtful.
RORY: I've been all over town looking for it. I've been to Lane's, I've been to Luke's, I've been to the bus stop, I've been to Miss Patty's, and I've circled Stars Hollow twice and nothing. I have no idea what I'm going to do.
JESS: It's really that big a deal?
RORY: What do you mean?
JESS: I mean, I know it's got an I've been pinned' Bye, Bye, Birdie kind of implication to it, but it was just a bracelet.
RORY: I don't think Dean will see it that way.
JESS: You didn't lose it on purpose.
RORY: I know, but things have been a little weird between us lately and. . .you couldn't care less.
JESS: Oh, yes, I could.
RORY: I just think Dean will read something into this.
JESS: Should he?
RORY: No.
JESS: I think you should keep looking.
RORY: Where?
JESS: Anywhere. Things you lose are usually right in front of your face. Check the house again.
RORY: I've checked the house.
JESS: It's probably just laying in your room somewhere.
RORY: No, I tore that room apart, it's not there.
JESS: Fine, give up then. No biggie. Dean'll just have to get over it.
RORY: I'll go look again.
JESS: You do that.
CUT TO INSIDE
[Lorelai is sitting on the couch reading as Rory walks in]
LORELAI: Hey, where have you been?
RORY: Scouring the town.
LORELAI: Nothing, huh?
RORY: Not yet. I'm gonna check my room again. [goes into room]
LORELAI: Haven't you already looked in there like a thousand times.
RORY: [from bedroom] A thousand and one. Mom, come here, hurry!
LORELAI: Rory?
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Are you okay?
[cut to Rory's bedroom]
RORY: I found it!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I looked under the bed and there it was. I thought I had already looked under the bed, but I don't know, maybe I was too panicked or. . .I don't know, who cares, I got it!
LORELAI: Aw, that is amazing!
RORY: Put it on.
LORELAI: Hmm.
RORY: Make it tight.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm cutting off circulation here, baby.
RORY: Oh, look at it. It looks even better than before, doesn't it?
LORELAI: I think the time away from home did it some good.
RORY: Okay, when I get back, we celebrate.
LORELAI: Where are you going?
RORY: To tell Lane she can stop praying.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai walks out as Jess is getting ready to leave]
LORELAI: You leaving?
JESS: Yeah, all done.
LORELAI: You weren't gonna come get your money?
JESS: Ah, I figured I'd get it eventually. It's not like I don't know where you guys live.
LORELAI: That's true. You certainly do know where we live. Well here. After all, you earned it.
JESS: Thanks.
LORELAI: You took it, didn't you?
JESS: Excuse me.
LORELAI: Rory's bracelet you had it the whole time.
JESS: No idea what you're talking about.
LORELAI: How'd you get it?
JESS: I didn't get anything.
LORELAI: What, did you break into our house, you got all dressed in black and pulled a Mission: Impossible?
JESS: Actually, I came down the chimney and pulled a Santa Claus.
LORELAI: Very funny.
JESS: Thought a ridiculous accusation deserved a ridiculous response.
LORELAI: So it's just a great big ol' coincidence that I catch you coming out of Rory's room a half an hour before she mysteriously finds the bracelet under her bed?
JESS: Guess so.
LORELAI: Why would you do this?
JESS: I gotta go.
LORELAI: I mean, I know you hate the world, but I thought you liked Rory.
JESS: I didn't do anything.
LORELAI: Bull.
JESS: Whatever.
LORELAI: Oh, don't whatever me, you little jerk. You let Rory run around completely panicked, thinking she lost her boyfriend's bracelet. She was miserable, do you understand that?
JESS: I didn't take it.
LORELAI: I'm sure you're jealous of Dean because he's great and Rory's madly in love with him, but you taking the bracelet didn't hurt Dean, it hurt Rory. That bracelet is the most precious thing she owns. She never takes it off. It means everything to her. And you stealing it was unbelievably cruel.
JESS: The most precious thing she owns?
LORELAI: Yes.
JESS: If it's the most precious thing she owns, why did it take her two weeks to figure out it was gone, huh? You might wanna reevaluate how madly in love she is. I wouldn't start calling him son yet.
LORELAI: Get outta here.
JESS: You read my mind.
CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai walks in and sits down on the couch. There's a knock on the front door, Lorelai answers it]
LUKE: I just spent a hundred thousand dollars and it's all your fault!
LORELAI: Oh, good.
[They walk into the kitchen]
LUKE: I ran into Taylor at the market, and I found out he owns the building that apartment was in.
LORELAI: No way.
LUKE: That and several others all over town.
LORELAI: That is so weird.
LUKE: He's systematically buying up the town. He's gonna turn it into Taylorville where everyone'll wear cardigans and have the same grass height.
LORELAI: Luke, do you wanna sit down?
LUKE: And then he told me he's gonna buy the building next to the diner, turn it into a plate shop for freaks who don't have enough brain power to collect stamps. I lost it.
LORELAI: Uh, I can't picture that.
LUKE: I walked around in a blind rage. I was crazy. I bought one of those Belgian waffles with the ice cream dipped in chocolate.
LORELAI: You ate that?
LUKE: No, I didn't eat it!
LORELAI: Of course not.
LUKE: I'm upset, not suicidal.
LORELAI: Right.
LUKE: I knew I just had to do something, and I had your voice going round and round in my head.
LORELAI: Yeah, it's kinda like the Small World song.
LUKE: Take a chance, Luke. Make a move, Luke. Can't have a single bed, Luke. So I bought the building!
LORELAI: You you what?
LUKE: I went to the bank and got a cashier's check, signed the papers and I bought the building.
LORELAI: Wow
LUKE: I am the building's owner.
LORELAI: I heard.
LUKE: I own the building.
LORELAI: Okay, well, don't worry, maybe you can still get out of it. You can go back and tell them you lost your mind.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: Or I bet you can sell it to Taylor.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: So, relax, you can still get out of this.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: Unless you don't wanna get out of it.
LUKE: Oh no, I wanna get out of this. Uh, why would I not wanna get out of this?
LORELAI: Oh, well, owning that building gives you some options.
LUKE: Like?
LORELAI: Uh, like you could expand Luke's if you wanted to.
LUKE: Yah.
LORELAI: Or you could rent it to someone else.
LUKE: Yah.
LORELAI: Someone else who might drive Taylor crazy.
LUKE: Maybe I should think about this.
LORELAI: Sure, sleep on it.
LUKE: Sleep on it, right, right.
LORELAI: You want some tea?
LUKE: Tea's good, sure.
LORELAI: Hey Luke, um, does Jess ever talk to you about Rory?
LUKE: Uh, what do you mean?
LORELAI: I don't know. They just. . .they seem to be thrown together quite a lot lately and I was just trying to figure out if that's a coincidence or - .
LUKE: Or if there's something going on.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: Huh.
LUKE: Jess doesn't exactly confide in me.
LORELAI: Right.
LUKE: Of course, if there was something going on, I think that'd be really great.
LORELAI: You do?
LUKE: Yeah. Rory's a great kid, she'd be really good for Jess.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, she would.
LUKE: You really think there might be something going on?
LORELAI: I don't know
LUKE: Boy, that would be great.
LORELAI: Yeah, great.
CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Jess is reading and listening to music as Luke walks in and takes a sledgehammer out of the closet. He walks across the room and swings the sledgehammer through the wall, then hands it to Jess.]
LUKE: That's your room. Finish up. We'll hold hands and skip afterwards.

OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER
[Luke's apartment is under construction. Luke delivers food to some customers, a chunk of the ceiling falls onto the table.]
LUKE: Here you go. Geez, uh, sorry folks. Uh, here. . .there we go. Free coffee all around. You might wanna put your hand over that. There we go. [walks over to construction worker] Tom, what the hell is going on up there?
TOM: We're redoing your apartment. What do you think is going on up there?
LUKE: The ceiling's falling in. I've got customers eating drywall here.
TOM: Oh, well, that can't be good.
LUKE: You said minimal disruptions.
TOM: Hey, this is minimal disruptions. Look, I need you to sign this change order.
LUKE: What happened now?
TOM: Well, we broke through this wall and we found some pipes that shouldn't be there. We gotta move them.
LUKE: Move them where?
TOM: Not sure. We gotta find out what they do first.
LUKE: You're kidding?
TOM: Oh yeah. There's nothing I like more than a good moving a pipe' joke.
LUKE: Fine, one more week, that's it.
TOM: Oh, sure, construction ultimatum. Ha, that's even funnier than my moving pipe joke.
[Lorelai and Rory walk in]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: Geez, look at this place.
RORY: It's a mess.
LORELAI: How long .
LUKE: Nope can't sit here.
LORELAI: Why not?
LUKE: Three people got nailed in the head here earlier.
LORELAI: But their food was okay, right?
LUKE: Will you just move? [Lorelai's cell phone rings] Outside.
LORELAI: You know, if I sit here one more second, I just might be outside. Order me some coffee.
[Lorelai walks away; Jess walks over to the table and hands Rory an open umbrella]
LUKE: Oh, you are really funny. You and Tom should put an act together. I'd leave it open.
[cut to outside]
LORELAI: Go ahead Mom, I can hear you now.
EMILY: I wanted to know if you'd like a gift certificate for a weekend at the Birch Grove Spa.
LORELAI: Are you serious?
EMILY: I bid on it at the DAR Symphony Fundraiser and I won.
LORELAI: Birch Grove? That's supposed to be an amazing place, why don't you go?
EMILY: Oh, I've never had any real desire to go to a spa.
LORELAI: Why'd you bid on it then?
EMILY: It was for charity, I had to bid on something. And I certainly didn't want another portrait of George Washington. I've got four in the attic already.
LORELAI: Well, I'd love it.
EMILY: Good.
LORELAI: Two days of total mind-numbing pampering. Massages, facials, aromatherapy.
EMILY: My goodness, you make it sound like heaven.
LORELAI: It's as close as you'll ever come to being a dog.
EMILY: I beg your pardon?
LORELAI: You know, a whole life of nothing but eating, sleeping, lying on your back and getting rubbed.
EMILY: I'd love the comparison to stop there.
LORELAI: Deal. Um, hey, when's it for?
EMILY: This weekend, actually.
LORELAI: Oh, well, I'll be there.
EMILY: So will I.
LORELAI: Excuse me?
EMILY: Well, the certificate is for two, and since you make it sound like the most wonderful place in the world, I might as well try it with you.
LORELAI: Oh, but - .
EMILY: That's all right, isn't it, if I join you? You don't mind?
LORELAI: No, I don't mind at all.
EMILY: Wonderful. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. You know, I'm actually looking forward to this.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, me too. Thanks Mom. Buh bye.
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S
[Rory is sitting at the table holding the umbrella over her head. Lorelai walks in and sits down]
LORELAI: I'm going to a spa with my mother.
RORY: Lean forward.
[opening credits]
CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM
[Lorelai is sitting on the bed as Rory walks around packing a suitcase]
LORELAI: [on phone] So, then we're all confirmed. Uh, great. Thanks so much for your help. Okay, bye. [hangs up] Yeeessss!
RORY: That was an evil yes.
LORELAI: Not an evil yes. It's a yes, I'm pretty, but hello, I'm smart' kind of a yes.
RORY: Oh, my mistake.
LORELAI: So here's the deal I go into my facial just as my mother is finishing her salt glow, which will end ten minutes after I've hit my scalp treatment which puts me in the watsu massage pool at least six minutes into her back facial. Uh, in fact, the day is so well planned, I won't see her until dinner which will be cut tragically short by the food poisoning I plan to contract.
RORY: You are twelve and disgusting.
LORELAI: I am trapped and desperate.
RORY: You really think you can avoid Grandma the entire weekend?
LORELAI: Hey, I'm nothing if not a great organizer. Now, let's talk about what you're gonna do tonight. Throwing a party, I hope? Inviting hundreds of bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?
RORY: I am going to do laundry, watch TV, order Indian food and go to bed early.
LORELAI: And then come the bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?
RORY: I may even fall asleep on the couch with the TV on.
LORELAI: When do the bikers and lowlifes get to trash the place?
RORY: You're all packed.
LORELAI: Rory, you have to do something bad when Mommy's out of town. It's the law. You're seen Risky Business, right? Now I'm not asking for a prostitution ring, but how about a floating craps game or something?
RORY: I'll see what I can do.
LORELAI: I would greatly appreciate it.

RORY: I think Grandma's here.
LORELAI: What's she honking for? She hates honking. She calls it a mechanical bodily function. [looks out window] Ugh, geez.
RORY: [looks out window] Oh, cool!
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Emily is standing in front of a limousine as Rory and Lorelai walk out of the house]
EMILY: Hello, hello, hello!
LORELAI: What, are we going to the prom?
EMILY: I just thought since this weekend is all about relaxing, we should start with the ride.
RORY: This is cool, Grandma.
EMILY: Thank you, Rory. So, are we all ready to go?
LORELAI: I guess so, Miss Daisy. Bye sweets.
RORY: Bye. Bye Grandma.
EMILY: Goodbye Rory.
RORY: Have a good time.
LORELAI: Bikers and lowlifes.
RORY: I'll get right on it.
CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM
TEACHER: In general, the lab reports weren't bad but they weren't great either, which leads me to question whether everyone has the grasp of electrochemistry I prefer before we move on. To that end, I will be giving another test on Tuesday covering chapters fourteen through eighteen in your textbooks, as well as the material from lab. Now please proceed with the assignment we all started yesterday, as that too will be included on the test.
PARIS: Madeline?
MADELINE: What?
PARIS: What are you guys doing tonight?
MADELINE: It's Friday night.
PARIS: So you've got dates?
MADELINE: Well, yeah, why?
PARIS: I was kind of hoping you could study with me.
MADELINE: On a Friday night?
PARIS: Yes.
MADELINE: But we've got dates.
LOUISE: What is she saying?
MADELINE: She wants us to study with her.
LOUISE: On a Friday night?
MADELINE: Yeah.
LOUISE: But we've got dates.
PARIS: I know you have dates, I was hoping maybe you'd cancel them.
MADELINE: To study?
PARIS: Yes.
MADELINE: On a Friday night?
LOUISE: What'd she say?
MADELINE: She wants us to cancel our dates to study.
LOUISE: On a Friday night?
MADELINE: That's what she said.
LOUISE: But we have - .
PARIS: Oh my God, forget it! [walks over to Rory] So, I suppose that you have big Friday night plans also?
RORY: Well, kind of.
PARIS: So the fact that I'm seeing my entire Harvard career slip away apparently is of no interest to anyone?
RORY: What are you talking about?
PARIS: I got an A-minus, okay?
RORY: So?
PARIS: What do you mean, so? I got an A-minus. I have never gotten an A-minus. I just can't focus lately. Things are so weird at my house. My dad finally figured out exactly how much it was gonna cost him to divorce my mom, so now he's back and it's bad enough that I wasted all that time crunching the numbers with him, but now that he's back, they're fighting and redecorating. The place is a mess. I need help.
RORY: Look, I can't tonight, but if you're still freaked out after the quiz on Tuesday, I will spend everyday next week helping you prepare for the final, okay?
PARIS: I guess.
RORY: Relax. It will be fine, I promise.
PARIS: All I had to do was move a decimal point and none of this would've happened.
CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA
[Emily and Lorelai walk into the lobby]
EMILY: Oh, look at this place. It's lovely. And that smell what is that, eucalyptus?
LORELAI: I don't know.
EMILY: Well, it's lovely. Oh Lorelai, come over here, look. They have cucumber slices in the water.
LORELAI: Oh wow! Now if they have ranch dressing in the soap dispensers, this place is great.
EMILY: You know what? I love it here.
LORELAI: Hm. Careful Mom, that's how they get you in the Moonies.
EMILY: I feel more relaxed already. Mm, that's the most delicious water I've ever had. Have a sip.
LORELAI: Let's just check in, shall we?
EMILY: Okay. [they walk to the front desk] Hello, I'm Emily Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai.
BOBBY: Ah, yes, welcome to Birch Grove. My name is Bobby. I have everything all set for you. Do you have luggage?
LORELAI: Yes, it's in the Luca Brasi mobile out front.
BOBBY: Okay, well, we can take care of that for you. Here are your room keys and a copy of all of your spa activities. You ladies are booked solid, I see.
EMILY: Well, we intend to leave here completely different people.
LORELAI: Yes, I'm going to be Ted Nugent.
BOBBY: Anyhow, your rooms are right down this hall. Fruit and yogurt is served by the pool in the mornings, and your lunch and dinner seatings are on that itinerary. Any questions?
LORELAI: Yes, where can one get a cup of coffee around here?
BOBBY: Ah, we don't serve anything with caffeine here.
LORELAI: And you think that's safe?
EMILY: Thank you, Bobby. We're sure we're going to have a wonderful time.
LORELAI: Mom, there's no coffee.
EMILY: It won't k*ll you to go two days without coffee, Lorelai.
LORELAI: No, I think it will.
EMILY: Lorelai, just focus on all the pampering we're going to have. Look at all the wonderful things we have to look forward to.
LORELAI: Oh no.
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: Oh, um, I'll be right back. They screwed up our appointments.
EMILY: Again?
LORELAI: What do you mean, again?
EMILY: Well, on the way to your house I called to confirm our schedule and found out they had us booked separately for every single one of our treatments. Luckily, I insisted on speaking to a manager and was able to straighten everything out. Yes, those are right.
LORELAI: They are?
EMILY: I even had them move the pedicure tubs together in the same room so we can talk during it.
LORELAI: Okay, I'm really gonna need a cup of coffee.
EMILY: Have some cucumber water.
LORELAI: No, see, that's not gonna do it because it's .
EMILY: Drink, Lorelai.
LORELAI: cucumber water. Yuck.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
[Rory and Dean are kissing by a tree]
RORY: Wow, your lung capacity certainly has improved.
DEAN: Well, I've been playing a lot more basketball lately.
RORY: Yet another reason to continue the fight to keep physical education in schools.
DEAN: So, tonight.
RORY: Yes?
DEAN: I was thinking.
RORY: Yes?
DEAN: Since your mother's gonna be gone.
RORY: Mm hmm.
DEAN: Maybe I'd come over.
RORY: Oh.
DEAN: What?
RORY: Actually, I was thinking of pulling kind of a hermit thing tonight.
DEAN: Why?
RORY: I don't know. J.D. Salinger seems to dig it.
DEAN: You don't want me to come over?
RORY: No, I just. . .I almost never get the house all to myself and I thought with my mom gone, I can finally do my laundry exactly the way I like it. You know, not just separated into whites and colors, but the colors separated into darks, mediums, and lights, with a separate pile for white T-shirts and T-shirts with some kind of writing on them, like, you know, Rock Star, Evil, or Kafka was here.
DEAN: You wanna be alone to do laundry?
RORY: And watch TV and eat the Indian food that I love but my mom hates the smell of and go to bed early and. . .are you mad?
DEAN: Why would I be mad? You wanna spend tonight alone.
RORY: But hey, tomorrow, the whole day is all about you. I mean it, from morning til night. You plan it, or I'll plan it, or we can get a professional to plan it, whatever you want. Just don't be mad.
DEAN: I'm not. I'm not mad.
RORY: Good.
DEAN: I'm confused, but I'm not mad.
RORY: Fine
DEAN: I'm a saint, but I'm not mad.
RORY: Thank you.
DEAN: You're welcome.
RORY: So, deep breath and. . .
CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA
[Lorelai is in her room unpacking. She hears knocking and opens the door to the hallway. No one's there, so she opens another door. Emily walks in wearing a bathrobe.]
EMILY: How do I look?
LORELAI: Like a landlady. What is this?
EMILY: I got adjoining rooms so we don't have to go out in the hallway to get to each other.
LORELAI: Great thinking!
EMILY: God, this robe is fabulous. How do they get it so soft?
LORELAI: Well, I think having about forty other people wear it first is part of the secret.
EMILY: Oh, stop it. So are you all ready for our skin rejuvenating and revitalizing collagen facial and eye treatment?
LORELAI: Almost.
EMILY: It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it, which is the hottest thing in skin care these days. And the eye treatment is supposed to reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines.
LORELAI: Okay, no more brochures for you. All right, I'm ready, let's go.
EMILY: Aren't you gonna wear your robe?
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Your robe, you're supposed to wear your robe.
LORELAI: Oh, well, I'm sure they'll give me one when I get there.
EMILY: But these robes are wonderful.
LORELAI: Mom.
EMILY: They help you relax.
LORELAI: We're late, Mom.
EMILY: They're wonderful, relaxing robes.
LORELAI: Oh my God.
EMILY: And yet, you stand there like it's some badge of honor not to put on your robe like everyone else in this place. [Lorelai goes into the bathroom to change] This isn't for me, you know, it's for you. I already have on my robe. I'm already relaxed. What are you doing?
LORELAI: [from bathroom] You're kidding me, right?
EMILY: Well, hurry up, we're gonna be late.
LORELAI: [opens bathroom door] Happy?
EMILY: Apparently you didn't see the matching slippers.
CUT TO FACIAL ROOM
FACIALIST: So, how are we doing?
LORELAI: So good.
FACIALIST: Okay. Well, I'm gonna leave you to sit for a few minutes, so just relax and enjoy, and I'll be right back.
LORELAI: Thanks.
[As the facialist leaves, Lorelai closes her eyes. Emily quietly enters the room and sits down next to Lorelai.]
EMILY: Are your feet sweating?
LORELAI: Mom?
EMILY: Those booties make my feet sweat. Don't they make your feet sweat?
LORELAI: What are you doing in my room?
EMILY: Magda left me sitting for twenty minutes. Fine time to take a coffee break.
LORELAI: She's not taking a coffee break. Your skin is supposed to be absorbing the moisture in your mask in your room.
EMILY: Let's see what's next on our agenda, shall we? Stop moving Lorelai, you'll electrocute yourself. Ooh, the Egyptian mud bath. I wonder if the mud bath is one of those things you see in brochures where they wrap you in towels like you're in a cocoon of some sort. That might be nice. Especially if their towels are as good as their robes because I just love these robes. I wonder where they get these robes. Shouldn't be so hard to find the manufacturer. I could order a few of them. One for me, one for you and one for Rory.
CUT TO HALLWAY
[Lorelai and Emily walk down the hallway in their robes]
EMILY: I still can't get over it, it really was mud. I mean, I know it said mud bath but I didn't really think they meant a real mud bath. And the odd thing is I should've been more repulsed by it. Sitting in a tub of hot dirt, which is basically what mud is, should've made me ill, and yet I really enjoyed it. Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs, and when I asked the woman about them, she told me they were there because of the healing qualities. . .
[they walk through a door marked Quiet Room.' A few seconds later, the door opens and Lorelai ushers Emily out into the hall]
EMILY: What are you doing? Lorelai, stop it! You're pushing me!
[Lorelai bangs on the door, showing Emily the Quiet Room' sign, then they walk back into the room]
CUT TO MASSAGE ROOM
[Lorelai and Emily are both getting massages.]
MASSEUR: How's the pressure too much?
LORELAI: Yup.
MASSEUR: Sorry, I'll go lighter.
EMILY: Your hands are amazing. Compliment your masseur's hands, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Oh my God.
EMILY: Excuse me?
LORELAI: Nothing.
EMILY: You were muttering under your breath. Years of experience have taught me that when you do that, it's usually about me.
LORELAI: Mom, you signed us up for a couple's massage.
EMILY: So?
LORELAI: A couple's massage is for a couple not a couple of people.
EMILY: It's more efficient this way. We'll both be finished at the same time.
LORELAI: Mom, do you know what most people who get these massages do about five minutes after it's over? They have s*x, together, probably while wearing their robes.
EMILY: Could the two of you excuse us for a moment please? Thank you. [the masseurs leave] Well, that was appalling!
LORELAI: Well, that was true!
EMILY: You're just determined to spoil this, aren't you, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Why, because I want a quiet, private massage?
EMILY: You've been pouting and sulking and sighing.
LORELAI: Oh, I have not been sighing.
EMILY: Rolling your eyes, mumbling.
LORELAI: Well, that's how I detox.
EMILY: Ever since we got here, you've made it your mission to be as miserable as possible.
LORELAI: That's not true.
EMILY: It's completely true. And if you don't care that you're hurting my feelings, maybe you care that you're wasting all your relaxing time acting like a petulant four-year-old.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry.
EMILY: Do you want me to try to get myself another room?
LORELAI: No.
EMILY: I saw a supply closet down the hall. Maybe my masseur could finish me in there.
LORELAI: Okay, Mom.
EMILY: Or perhaps I could just roll myself against a stucco wall, eliminate the need for a masseur altogether.
LORELAI: Lie down Mom, please.
EMILY: If you say so. Lorelai?
LORELAI: Yes, Mom?
EMILY: Would you go get the boys, please?
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory, while on the phone, is sitting on the living room floor surrounded by piles of clothes]
RORY: No, that's two orders of garlic gnon, three simosas, and a chicken vindiloo. And rice, and the green sauce, and no salad, and. . . oh wait, sorry. Can you hold on a sec? [answers the call waiting] Hello?
LORELAI: Hi, this is Phil's Liquor. I'm supposed to be delivering a keg there tonight.
RORY: Hold on. [switches to other call] Hi, sorry. Yeah, that's it. Forty minutes, great. Bye. [switches back] Hey.
LORELAI: Who was that?
RORY: Sandeep's.
LORELAI: Oh, you're ordering the Indian food?
RORY: Yup.
LORELAI: Good, enjoy. Can you burn the house down afterward, cause that's the only way we'll get the smell out.
RORY: Absolutely. How's the spa?
LORELAI: Tranquil.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: I wasn't done. Tranquilizers, uh, will be required if I have to spend one more minute with my mother.
RORY: Please tell me you're at least trying to get along with her?
LORELAI: Oh, hey, I'm being a peach.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Well, I smell like a peach. Was that the doorbell?
RORY: Yeah, I'll call you later.
LORELAI: Oh wait, I wanna find out who it is.
RORY: The sooner you get back to your weekend, the sooner it'll be over.
LORELAI: Okay, but before you go, can you get out my address book and count how many friends I have? I'll wait.
RORY: Bye.
LORELAI: Mean!
RORY: Steal me soap! [hangs up the phone, then opens the front door] Paris. What -.
PARIS: I tried to stay home and study myself but I can't. I don't know what anything means anymore. I mean, I can't even read my own handwriting. What does this say? The person who wrote this should be dressed in a clown suit stuffing bodies under their porch. You're in your pajamas.
RORY: I know.
PARIS: This was the big night you had planned a rendezvous with Mr. Peanut?
RORY: Well...
PARIS: You're doing laundry.
RORY: Yes.
PARIS: You're doing laundry in your pajamas.
RORY: My mom is out of town and I never get the house all to myself.
PARIS: You mean you never get to go months on end without seeing your parents, just getting an occasional postcard that doesn't even have a courtesy "Wish you were here" written on it? That does suck. Don't let me stand in your way.
RORY: Paris, wait.
PARIS: No, forget it, I don't want to get in the way of your big night. I hear there's gonna be some hot knitting going on later.
RORY: Fine, I'll study with you.
PARIS: You will?
RORY: For one hour, that's it. We can do a quick review and a pop quiz and then you are going home. Deal?
PARIS: Deal.
RORY: Okay, so, go sit on the couch. I'll be out in the minute.
PARIS: Where are you going?
RORY: I'm going to go change.
PARIS: Okay, but my hour doesn't start until you get back out here, right?
CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA
[Emily walks into Lorelai's room]
EMILY: Are you ready?
LORELAI: Wow, you look great, Mom.
EMILY: Are you being sarcastic?
LORELAI: No, I'm being completely serious.
EMILY: Oh, well, thank you. That's a pretty color. What is that?
LORELAI: It's called Vicious Trollop.
EMILY: Oh, stop it! Now why would you name a lipstick something like that?
LORELAI: Cause dirty whore' was taken?
EMILY: You frighten me.
LORELAI: You wanna try some?
EMILY: No, thank you.
LORELAI: Go on, Mom, try it.
EMILY: It won't look good on me.
LORELAI: Sure it will.
EMILY: Well, all right, but if I look ridiculous. . .
LORELAI: I'll be the first one to point it out. You're a vicious trollop, you're a vicious trollop.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Sorry.
EMILY: Well?
LORELAI: I like it.
EMILY: You do? I like it too.
LORELAI: Good, let's go then, I'm starving.
EMILY: Oh, me too. What are they serving for dinner tonight?
LORELAI: Well, let's see. [looks at menu] Hmm.
EMILY: They certainly do like their tofu here, don't they?
LORELAI: And the word steamed. Well, they have dessert at least. Cookies sweetened with sprouted mungbean.
EMILY: That sounds dreadful.
LORELAI: Yes, it does.
EMILY: Where are you going? You aren't going to change, are you? Our seating's in ten minutes.
LORELAI: Get your coat.
EMILY: I don't need a coat to go to the dining room.
LORELAI: We're not going to the dining room.
EMILY: Well, where are we going?
LORELAI: Out.
EMILY: Out where?
LORELAI: We're gonna leave the spa, find a restaurant, and have a steak.
EMILY: A steak?
LORELAI: Who's gonna stop us?
EMILY: A steak.
LORELAI: Come on, Mom. What's it gonna be vicious trollop or the wide world of mungbeans?
EMILY: Let's go.
LORELAI: I'm right behind you.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory and Paris are studying in the living room]
RORY: So, given that those are the reactions occurring in the two half-cells, what do you do next?
PARIS: Well, if we add them together, doubling the coefficients of the silver half equation but not the voltage, we get the equation for the complete reaction.
RORY: Well, you're in much better shape than you wanna think you are.
PARIS: Impossible. [doorbell rings; Rory walks toward the door] Where are you going?
RORY: That's my food.
PARIS: Another half hour, please!
RORY: No, you got your hour. You need to go.
PARIS: But .
RORY: Go!
PARIS: Fine.
[Rory opens the door. Jess is holding a box of food]
JESS: Delivery.
RORY: What are you doing here?
JESS: Well, Luke figured since you're along tonight that maybe you wouldn't have any food in the house, so he sent over a care package.
RORY: I don't need a care package. I ordered food from Sandeep's.
JESS: Really? Planning on burning down the house afterwards?
RORY: Jess.
JESS: The only way to k*ll the smell. Where should I put this? [walks into house]
RORY: Well. . .
JESS: Kitchen?
RORY: Um. . .sure.
[cut to kitchen]
RORY: God, how much food is in there? This could feed twelve.
JESS: Excuse me, I've seen you eat.
RORY: Fine, six.
JESS: Yeah, well, he wanted you taken care of. He wasn't sure how long your mom was gonna be gone for.
RORY: Just tonight.
JESS: Oh, he didn't know that.
RORY: Well, now you can tell him.
JESS: I will.
RORY: So how come Caesar didn't bring this over?
JESS: I volunteered.
RORY: Why?
JESS: Just wanted to get out of the construction zone. There's nothing but banging and yelling. That place gives me a headache.
RORY: Oh.
JESS: Why did you think I wanted to come over here and see you?
RORY: No.
JESS: Just needed some quiet.
RORY: Fine.
JESS: That is all.
RORY: Got it.
JESS: Clear my head.
RORY: I understand.
JESS: So, aren't you gonna eat?
RORY: Eventually.
JESS: It gets cold fast.
RORY: I can heat it up.
JESS: Reheated French fries really suck.
RORY: Hm, they do suck.
JESS: Yeah, so, eat.
RORY: Okay, I will. You're still standing there.
JESS: I know. You didn't give me a tip.
RORY: You want money?
JESS: No, I'll take a fry though.
RORY: Okay, yeah, have as much as you want.
JESS: Okay, great. [takes off jacket]
RORY: What are you doing?
JESS: Getting ready to eat.
RORY: You're staying?
JESS: Didn't you just invite me?
RORY: No, I -.
JESS: No, you told me to have all I wanted. That sounded invitation-like.
RORY: You wanna stay here and eat?
JESS: Beats being at Luke's.
RORY: But .
PARIS: [walks in from living room] I can't find my flashcards.
JESS: I didn't know you had company.
RORY: This is Paris. We were just studying.
JESS: Huh.
PARIS: Don't worry, I was just leaving. If you find my flashcards, call me, okay?
RORY: No.
PARIS: What?
RORY: Stay for dinner.
PARIS: But I thought. . .
RORY: We have a ton of food, and we can go over the notes more later.
PARIS: You're sure?
RORY: Positive.
PARIS: Is that mac and cheese?
RORY: It sure is.
PARIS: I love mac and cheese.
RORY: Great.
PARIS: I'm not allowed to have mac and cheese.
RORY: Splurge. Come on Paris, stay.
PARIS: Do you have a twenty-four hour pharmacy just in case I have an allergic reaction to something?
RORY: Believe it or not, we do.
PARIS: Okay, can I borrow your phone?
RORY: It's by the door.
[Paris walks away]
JESS: Interesting.
RORY: What is?
JESS: You think we need a chaperone?
RORY: No, I don't.
JESS: You just invited one.
RORY: I'm just being polite. Paris is alone tonight and you yourself just said we have enough food for six.
JESS: With me around, it's down to four.
RORY: With Paris around, it's down to two.
JESS: Works out well.
RORY: I think so.
PARIS: [on phone] Hola, es Paris. Voy a comer la cena de cas de Rory. Hay mucho mac and cheese!
CUT TO RESTAURANT
[Emily and Lorelai check their coats, then walk toward the hostess]
EMILY: My goodness, look at this place.
LORELAI: I bet there's no cucumber slices in the water here. [to hostess] Hi there, party of two.
HOSTESS: Okay. Uh, well, I can take your name, but I probably won't have a table for about an hour.
LORELAI: An hour!
EMILY: I can't wait an hour.
LORELAI: Me either.
EMILY: I'll pass out.
LORELAI: Go first, you can break my fall.
EMILY: Can we bribe you?
HOSTESS: Sorry.
LORELAI: Please? She's loaded.
EMILY: Lorelai!
HOSTESS: You know, a couple of stools just opened up at the bar, and we do serve our entire menu there.
LORELAI: That is a great idea. Thanks. Come on.
EMILY: We cannot eat dinner at a bar.
LORELAI: I don't wanna wait an hour, and I'm wearing the wrong shoes for a drive thru.
EMILY: But what are people going to think?
LORELAI: That we're loose women with questionable morals.
[they sit down at the bar]
EMILY: Doesn't seem right to eat dinner when your feet aren't touching the floor.
BARTENDER: What can I get you ladies?
LORELAI: Hi Steve, nice to meet you. We will have two. . .martinis?
EMILY: Why not?
LORELAI: Two vodka martinis, straight up with a twist, very dry, very cold, and a couple of menus, please.
EMILY: And some peanuts.
LORELAI: Ah, peanuts, good idea.
BARTENDER: Here you go, I'll get your drinks.
LORELAI: Thank you. You're a good man, Steve. Okay, I'm thinking steak and Caesar salad if it's not too anchovy-y, and hey do you wanna split a shrimp cocktail to start?
EMILY: That sounds fine.
LORELAI: Ah, I just love the idea of shrimp cocktail with a steak dinner, you know? It's so Casino, Big Joe, steak and shrimp hey, save some for winter, there.
EMILY: I never realized how wonderful peanuts were before.
BARTENDER: Want a refill?
EMILY: Oh, yes, please.
LORELAI: Cheers, Mom.
EMILY: Cheers. I must tell you, I never expected this.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Me inhaling peanuts at a singles bar.
LORELAI: This isn't a singles bar, Mom. It's a sixty-forty bar.
EMILY: A what?
LORELAI: Sixty-year-old men hitting on forty-year-old women, divorcees mostly.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: Look around.
EMILY: Hm. Oh, now, she can do better than that. What does she see in him?
LORELAI: Big will, short life span, the usual draw. Hey Mom.
EMILY: I wonder if they have pretzels, too.
LORELAI: Don't look now, but I think you're passing for a forty-year-old woman.
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: Two o'clock, silver fox, totally checking you out.
EMILY: Oh, he is not.
LORELAI: Well, he's not staring at Steve.
EMILY: You're being ridiculous. He's definitely not looking at me.
LORELAI: He's still looking.
EMILY: Drink your martini, Lorelai.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory, Paris, and Jess are eating at the kitchen table]
PARIS: A tragic waste of paper.
JESS: I can't believe you just said that.
PARIS: Well, it's true, the Beat's writing was completely self-indulgent. I have one word for Jack Kerouac edit.
JESS: It was not self-indulgent. The Beats believed in shocking people, stirring things up.
PARIS: They believed in drugs, booze, and petty crime.
RORY: Well, then you can say that they exposed you to a world you wouldn't have otherwise known. Isn't that what great writing's all about?
PARIS: That was not great writing. That was the National Enquirer of the fifties.
JESS: You're cracked.
PARIS: Typical guy response. Worship Kerouac and Bukowski, God forbid you'd pick up anything by Jane Austen.
JESS: Hey, I've read Jane Austen.
PARIS: You have?
JESS: Yeah, and I think she would've liked Bukowski.
PARIS: What are you doing?
JESS: Salt and pepper dip. Only way to eat a fry.
PARIS: Really?
RORY: It's fast food gospel.
PARIS: Mm. That's good. That's really, really good.
[phone rings]
JESS: You like hot sauce?
PARIS: I don't know. Should I?
JESS: I think it's wise.
RORY: [answers phone] Hello?
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Oh, hey. Where are you?
DEAN: On my way to see you if that's okay?
RORY: Oh, well -
DEAN: I know you wanna be alone, so I'll only stay a minute. I just wanna say hi.
RORY: We just said hi.
DEAN: Well, I wanna say hi a little closer.
RORY: But, I'm a mess, really. It's not pretty. You won't recognize me.
DEAN: Well, then put a name tag on cause I miss you.
RORY: I miss you too, but
DEAN: But what?
RORY: But. . .Paris is here.
DEAN: Why?
RORY: She freaked out about a grade and she wanted to go over some notes, and you know Paris she will not be denied.
DEAN: Okay, then I'm not really ruining your alone night, someone else did that.
RORY: Yes, but
DEAN: I'll see you in a sec. [hangs up]
JESS: I can't get into poetry. It's kind of like, geez, just say it already, we're dying here.
RORY: Wow, you know, I just noticed the time, and it's getting really late.
JESS: It's seven o'clock.
RORY: I know, but Paris and I still have a lot more studying to do. Jess, please thank Luke for me. It was really nice of him.
JESS: Who was on the phone?
RORY: No one.
JESS: No one wouldn't happen to be heading over here now, would he?
RORY: Jess.
PARIS: What's going on?
RORY: Nothing.
JESS: Dean's on his way over and Rory doesn't want him to find me here.
RORY: Why?
JESS: Yeah, why?
RORY: You know why.
JESS: We're just eating dinner.
RORY: Jess, I'm asking you as a friend, just please leave now.
JESS: You really want me to go?
RORY: I really wanna avoid a fight with Dean.
JESS: Okay, I'm going.
RORY: Thank you.
JESS: Ow!
RORY: What?
JESS: Ooh! I just twisted my ankle. I better go lie down.
RORY: Jess!
JESS: God, you're no fun when you're tense. Are you sure you want me to go? Cause maybe this whole thing can be solved between me and Dean if we just sat down and had a little heart to heart. He can tell me his issues, I'll tell him mine.
RORY: Jess!
JESS: I promise I'll speak slowly.
RORY: Bye! [pushes him out the front door]
JESS: Okay, well, give him my best, would ya? [sees Dean in the front yard] Actually, I guess I could do that myself.
RORY: Dean, Jess just came by to bring me some food.
JESS: From Luke's.
RORY: He wanted to make sure I ate.
JESS: Luke did.
RORY: Right, Luke did.
JESS: Personally, I could care less if she eats.
RORY: Yeah, true, he could care less.
JESS: I see you brought a little something, too. Is that ice cream? That's so nice. A tiny little ice cream package just big enough for two. Hey, are you guys gonna feed each other cause that's just so darn cute. Oops. You're doing that towering over me thing. Huh. I tell you, you've really got that down. It helps that you're twelve feet tall, but this Frankenstein scowl really adds to the whole .
RORY: Jess.
JESS: Okay, I'm going. Look, man, I really was just dropping off some food, so don't get all West Side Story on me, okay? [leaves]
RORY: So, do you wanna. . . [Dean walks into the house] . . .come in?
[cut to kitchen]
DEAN: What the hell is going on?
PARIS: Hi.
RORY: Dean, you remember Paris, right?
DEAN: Yeah, hi. So Jess just dropped this off, huh?
RORY: Oh, well. . .
DEAN: Now I know you eat fast, but this is a lot of food to put away that quickly, even on your best day.
RORY: Okay, so he didn't just drop it off but - .
DEAN: You told me you were doing laundry tonight.
RORY: I was.
DEAN: And now you are here with Jess.
RORY: And Paris!
DEAN: Jess, Rory!
RORY: Ah, well, I swear, I didn't
DEAN: You didn't what? You didn't know he was coming over?
RORY: I didn't.
DEAN: And you also didn't know he was gonna stay, right?
RORY: It just happened.
DEAN: How does that just happen?
RORY: Well, he was. . .and the diner, the diner was. . .and I. . .
DEAN: And you what? What? Say something!
RORY: Stop yelling!
DEAN: You totally lied to me!
RORY: I didn't!
DEAN: Turn the situation around, Rory! How's it looking?
RORY: It's looking complicated and I'm trying to explain it to you.
DEAN: Ugh, that's crap.
PARIS: It's my fault.
DEAN: What?
PARIS: It's my fault that Jess was here. I saw him in the diner the day I came to Stars Hollow and I thought he was cute and since I'm not great at the whole batting the eyelashes, look at my belly shirt' kind of thing, I asked Rory to help me. I thought if she could maybe get him over here, we'd have a chance to talk and. . .I don't know, it seems totally stupid now and it obviously didn't work shock, but that's why he was here. Thanks for trying to cover for me.
RORY: That's okay.
PARIS: Anyway, I should get going. I'm probably gonna break out in some sort of rash any second now. [leaves kitchen]
DEAN: So Paris likes Jess?
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: Rory, is this true?
RORY: Yes it is.
DEAN: Paris and Jess?
RORY: I know. There's no explaining attraction. Dean, listen to me, if I was going to have anyone over tonight, it definitely would've been you.
DEAN: Okay.
RORY: Really?
DEAN: Well, if you say so, then I have to believe it, don't I?
RORY: Yes.
DEAN: Well, okay then. I'm sorry that I yelled.
RORY: Completely justified under the circumstances.
DEAN: I'm gonna get going.
RORY: No, wait, don't you wanna stay for ice cream? We could hang out.
DEAN: Nah, I'm just gonna go.
RORY: I'm still seeing you tomorrow, right?
DEAN: Yeah, sure.
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: See you tomorrow. [leaves]
[Rory walks into the living room]
RORY: What was that?
PARIS: What?
RORY: That, the story, the save? You helped me. Why would you do that?
PARIS: I don't know, it just came out.
RORY: You have no idea what you did.
PARIS: It was no big deal.
RORY: No, it was a very big deal. It was a huge deal.
PARIS: Well, you helped me tonight when you didn't want to, so I owed you.
RORY: Thank you.
PARIS: You're welcome. Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your alone night.
RORY: You should stay.
PARIS: Stay?
RORY: Yeah. We could hang out, maybe watch some TV. You can even spend the night if you don't wanna drive all the way back to Hartford.
PARIS: Spend the night, like a slumber party?
RORY: Sort of.
PARIS: You're just doing this because I lied to Dean for you, right?
RORY: I'm doing this because it's what you do with friends.
PARIS: We're friends?
RORY: I'm not sure if there is an exact definition for what we are, but I do think it falls somewhere in the bizarro friends-ish realm. Come on, stay.
PARIS: Okay. But if you're doing all this so you can freeze my bra, I'll k*ll you.
RORY: Duly noted.
CUT TO RESTAURANT
[Lorelai and Emily are eating dinner.]
EMILY: This is either the greatest steak I've ever eaten, or I'm so hungry, I'm delirious. Pass the horseradish, please.
LORELAI: I never knew you were a spicy girl.
EMILY: Oh, believe me, I can handle my heat. One summer when we were first married, your father and I stayed at this little village in Thailand where we spent two weeks eating viciously hot chilies and skinny-dipping.
LORELAI: Ah, Mom!
EMILY: Well, you certainly couldn't put your clothes on after eating those things.
LORELAI: Stop it! I like to think of parents the old fashioned way separate bedrooms.
FEMALE SINGER: And now it's time for my favorite part of the evening our salute to the Chairman of the Board.
MALE SINGER: I sure hope that's not b-o-r-e-d.
LORELAI: Uh, uh, Mom?
EMILY: Yes?
LORELAI: Remember the man who wasn't staring at you?
EMILY: He wasn't staring at me.
LORELAI: Okay, well, he's coming over.
EMILY: What?
CHAD: Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting, but I couldn't help but notice that you two are having more fun than anyone at the bar.
LORELAI: Well, that's true, we are.
CHAD: Well, good, I've come to the right place. Hi, I'm Chad.
LORELAI: Hi Chad. I'm Lorelai. This is my mother, Emily.
CHAD: Your mother?
LORELAI: Chad, if the next words out of your mouth are, you can't possibly be old enough to be her mother,' I'm gonna have to cause you severe physical pain.
CHAD: Emily, do you share this rather extreme opinion?
EMILY: I think I'll stay out of it.
CHAD: In that case, let me just say that I think you look more like sisters than mother and daughter. Yeah, I went for a variation.
LORELAI: I'll let it slide this time.
CHAD: So, are you two, uh, local or just visiting?
LORELAI: Visiting. Mom's from Hartford and I'm from a town, uh
CHAD: Hartford? Great town, great town. A little of the old, little of the new. You like living there?
EMILY: Well, yes, I do.
LORELAI: And how about you, Chad where do you live?
CHAD: Here and by here, I mean this very bar stool.
LORELAI: Wow, admitting right off the bat that you spend your life at a bar. Do you find that people are impressed by that?
CHAD: Until now.
EMILY: Oh, I love this song.
CHAD: It's a great song for dancing.
EMILY: Yes, it is.
CHAD: Help me out here, will ya?
LORELAI: I think he's asking you to dance, Mom.
EMILY: What? Oh, no, I, uh, I couldn't.
CHAD: Rumor has it you love this song.
EMILY: Oh, well, yes, but I don't dance.
CHAD: Oh, come on. I can't believe that.
EMILY: And I shouldn't leave my daughter alone.
LORELAI: That's okay. The sitter'll be here any minute.
EMILY: Really, I'm serious, you should ask someone else.
CHAD: Is it my dancing? Because you two could work out some kind of save me' signal in case I really embarrass you.
LORELAI: Go ahead, Mom. It'll be fun.
CHAD: Come on, the song's almost over. You'll hardly have to spend any time at all with me.
EMILY: All right.
[they start dancing]
BARTENDER: Hey, your mom looks good out there.
LORELAI: Yup, she sure does.
[When the song ends, Emily starts to walk away but Chad pulls her closer for another dance. After a few seconds, Emily breaks away from him.]
EMILY: I'm sorry, I have to go.
[She quickly walks over to the coat check area. Lorelai gets up and follows her]
LORELAI: Mom, what's wrong?
EMILY: We're leaving.
LORELAI: What happened?
EMILY: I shouldn't have been doing this.
LORELAI: Doing what?
EMILY: Fraternizing with other men.
LORELAI: Oh, what are you talking about?
EMILY: I practically cheated on your father.
LORELAI: You did not cheat on Dad.
EMILY: I danced with another man.
LORELAI: You've danced with other men before.
EMILY: Not like that, not without your father present.
LORELAI: Oh, Mom, it was just a dance. You were having fun.
EMILY: I need to get out of here. How hard is it to find a coat?
LORELAI: Mom, you didn't do anything wrong.
EMILY: I don't know why I let you take me to this chop house in the first place. I don't go to chop houses. What were you thinking?
LORELAI: Need food now.
EMILY: And I certainly don't eat at bars. Hookers eat at bars.
LORELAI: Only if they can't get a table.
EMILY: You're not funny. You knew this whole evening made me uncomfortable and yet you kept pushing.
LORELAI: I was trying to do everything right. You manipulated me into taking this trip and still I came. You told me I was acting like a teenager, so I tried to be nicer. You said you needed to eat, so I made that happen.
EMILY: Yes, by sitting me at a bar where you practically forced me to engage in inappropriate behavior.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: You let me get sixty-fortied!
LORELAI: You are crazy! Do you know that? We were having dinner, Mom, a nice dinner. We were talking. Hell, we were having fun.
EMILY: Oh, so watching your mother make an ass of herself was fun for you?
LORELAI: God, you know, you don't have any right to complain about this relationship if you're not willing to let your guard down once in awhile and just be normal.
EMILY: There's a way for a mother to behave in front of her daughter. I'm sorry if you don't like it, but that's how it is.
CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA
[Lorelai is in her room, packing. There's a knock on the door.]
LORELAI: Come in.
EMILY: I called the bellman to get the bags. He said it would be around ten minutes.
LORELAI: Okay.
EMILY: Thank you for agreeing to leave early.
LORELAI: No problem.
EMILY: I guess this whole thing was a silly idea anyway. I don't know why I pushed it. We can't even get through a dinner without a fight. What was I thinking putting us together for a weekend?
LORELAI: It was a nice thought, Mom.
EMILY: Yes, well, I guess it's the thought that counts, isn't it?
LORELAI: You know, if you want, um, I can just bring our bags down. I mean, they're not that heavy, and then we don't have to wait.
EMILY: Well, that sounds fine. Why can't we have what you and Rory have?
LORELAI: Rory and I are different mom.
EMILY: We're mother and daughter, you're mother and daughter. It shouldn't be that different.
LORELAI: It's completely different. It couldn't be more different.
EMILY: But why?
LORELAI: I grew up in a different environment.
EMILY: You mean an oppressive environment.
LORELAI: No, Mom, I mean a different environment. And plus, I was so young when I had Rory.
EMILY: So because I waited until I was grown and married, I can't have a relationship with my daughter?
LORELAI: No.
EMILY: Well, then, why?
LORELAI: Rory and I are best friends, Mom. We are best friends first and mother and daughter second, and you and I are mother and daughter always.
EMILY: I wasn't taught to be best friends with my daughter.
LORELAI: I know.
EMILY: I was taught to be a role model for my daughter.
LORELAI: I know that, too.
EMILY: I did what I thought was right. I did what I thought I had to do to protect you, and because of this we have no relationship.
LORELAI: Oh, Mom, we have a relationship.
EMILY: We do? What? What is our relationship?
LORELAI: Well, we. . .
EMILY: Exactly.
LORELAI: Maybe an intense weekend together was not the best idea for us. Maybe we need to start with something simpler.
EMILY: Like what, a brisk walk around the block?
LORELAI: No, I hate exercise.
EMILY: Oh, well, as long as you find this amusing.
LORELAI: Mom, come on. There has to be something else. Something small.
EMILY: Like what? Where are you going? Lorelai, you just don't walk out on a person. That's rude. That's a robe.
LORELAI: Yes, this is my robe. And I want you to go into your room and get your robe. And then, exactly at the same time, we are gonna shove these robes in our suitcases and we are gonna walk out that door and leave with them.
EMILY: That's stealing.
LORELAI: Yes, it is.
EMILY: You want me to steal a robe? That's how we're going to bond?
LORELAI: Mom, you love this robe. You've talked about nothing else except this robe since we got here, so this robe will be symbolic of our trip together.
EMILY: But that's crazy. As soon as they check the rooms, they're going to know the robes are gone and then they're going to charge our credit card.
LORELAI: Well, how do you know?
EMILY: Because that's what the little tag on the hanger says.
LORELAI: Well, the little tag on the hanger could be right, or the little tag on the hanger could just be there trying to scare us away from trying. Either way, whether we get away with it or not, it's something we did, you and I.
EMILY: You're serious.
LORELAI: I am folding this robe up.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: I am putting this robe in my bag.
EMILY: That's lunacy.
LORELAI: I am zipping up the bag that contains the robe.
EMILY: I have a perfectly good robe at home.
LORELAI: Now the only question is, am I doing it alone?
EMILY: Did you ever steal a robe with Rory?
LORELAI: No, Rory would never steal. She's far too moral for that. You, however, vicious trollop what's it gonna be?
EMILY: I should have my head examined.
LORELAI: We'll make an appointment when we get back.
EMILY: You do know, in the course of one night, you've turned me into an adulterer and a thief.
LORELAI: I'll have you working at the chicken ranch by the end of the month.
EMILY: I cannot believe I'm doing this.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table.]
RORY: You actually got Grandma to steal a bathrobe?
LORELAI: Although I did catch her trying to return it while I was getting the car.
RORY: Still.
LORELAI: I know, life with my mother, one step forward, five thousand steps back. It's kinda like the spastic polka.
KIRK: Excuse me, are you done?
LORELAI: No, uh, sorry, not yet.
KIRK: So, you're gonna eat that half a piece of bacon that's been sitting there for ten minutes?
LORELAI: Kirk.
KIRK: I mean, of course, you must be if you're saying you're not done because that's the only thing left in front on you, unless you eat plates.
LORELAI: Go away.
KIRK: You are hogging the table.
LORELAI: You keep it up, I'm ordering seconds.
KIRK: Fine.
LORELAI: So, Paris looked a little green this morning.
RORY: Yeah, she had a sugar/carb hangover of monumental proportions.
LORELAI: People don't realize it, but it takes years of training to be able to eat the way we do.
RORY: Don't I know it.
LORELAI: So, what's on the agenda for today?
RORY: Let's see. Dean, Dean, and uh. . .oh, did I mention Dean?
LORELAI: Wow, he must've been crazy mad last night.
RORY: I'd say that was a fair assessment.
LORELAI: Okay, I gotta get to the inn.
RORY: Okay. Well, I'm probably gonna have dinner with Dean, so. . .
LORELAI: I'll have the house to myself tonight. Life's funny, isn't it?
RORY: I simply cannot stop laughing. I'll get the check.
LORELAI: Thanks hon.
RORY: [walks to the counter] Hey Luke.
LUKE: What, you find a nail in your food? I swear to God, Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!
RORY: There's nothing wrong with the food, Luke.
LUKE: Oh, sorry Tom.
RORY: I just wanted to thank you.
LUKE: Yeah, for what?
RORY: For the care package. It was really sweet of you.
LUKE: What care package?
JESS: Hey Luke, I think they hit the water line again.
LUKE: Oh, what? [walks away] Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!
RORY: Huh, interesting.
JESS: Hey, you wanna pay?
RORY: I don't think Luke knew anything about the food last night.
JESS: That'll be twelve-fifty.
RORY: Which means you lied about why you came over.
JESS: I don't have any quarters. I'm gonna have to give you nickels.
RORY: Now why would you lie about something like that?
JESS: Here's your change. Come again soon.
RORY: You wanted to come over.
JESS: I have to get back to work.
RORY: You're squirming. I've never seen you squirm. It's entertaining.
JESS: Oh yeah?
RORY: Yeah.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai walks out of the diner. Dean is standing out front.]
LORELAI: Dean, hey.
DEAN: Hey.
LORELAI: Rory's just inside paying. She's coming out to meet you after.
DEAN: Yeah, we're gonna spend the day together.
LORELAI: That's great.
DEAN: Yeah, it is.
LORELAI: So, listen, Rory told me everything that happened last night. She feels just terrible about it.
DEAN: I know.
LORELAI: Good, you should. It's just one of those freaky unfortunate things that happens.
DEAN: Freaky and unfortunate, yeah.
LORELAI: She had nothing to do with Jess coming over. Believe me, she did not want him there.
DEAN: That's what she told me. And Rory wouldn't lie, right?
LORELAI: No, Rory wouldn't lie.

OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE
[The phone is ringing. Lorelai rushes down the steps to answer it, but the machine picks up before she can get it.]
LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message.
EMILY: I am so tired of this ridiculous machine. I get it every time I call. . .
LORELAI: Oh, that was close.
EMILY: You are Rory are always out. What is it that you do? Is your house that awful you can't be in it? It's too much excitement, if you ask me. . .
LORELAI: Well, what isn't in Emily's rules of conduct?
EMILY: I don't want to talk to a machine, I'll just call you later. [hangs up]
LORELAI: If you had your way, Mother, you'd lock us up like veal. That's what she wants, veal children.
[phone rings again]
LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message.
EMILY: It's me again. Listen. . .
LORELAI: You're talking into the machine.
EMILY: Don't forget that my DAR meeting is on Tuesday. Please. . .
LORELAI: It's burned into my brain. It's there forever.
EMILY: . . . it's at three o'clock and all the women are all extremely punctual.
LORELAI: When I'm senile and ga-ga and drooling into a cup, and yet I can't remember my name, I'll still remember that your DAR meeting is that Tuesday.
EMILY: . . . this Tuesday. I'll talk to you about some other things later. [hangs up]
LORELAI: I'm gonna have to be de-programmed by cult de-programmers to get that Tuesday out of my brain.
[phone rings again]
LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message.
EMILY: Your phone message is annoying. . .
LORELAI: Unbelievable.
EMILY: Do you know how annoying it is?
LORELAI: I think I have a standard against which to measure it.
EMILY: . . .to it yourself. Have you heard it lately?
LORELAI: I can't because I'm amputating my ears.
EMILY: . . .and that thumb bashing thing, is that a joke? Why is it that your jokes are always. . .
LORELAI: Ah, an earless world, what a dream!
[opening credits]
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[In the dining room, Emily is sitting at a table tasting soups as Lorelai and Sookie stand by watching.]
LORELAI: Haven't you already tasted that one, Mom?
EMILY: Mm.
LORELAI: Twice, you've tasted that soup twice.
EMILY: You're keeping a running count?
LORELAI: I'm morbidly fascinated.
EMILY: Well, Lorelai, when you're tasting anything, the first taste acclimates the palate, the second establishes the foundation, and the third is to make your decision.
LORELAI: Oh, there's going to be a third taste.
EMILY: Isn't that what this is for to taste the soups?
LORELAI: Taste them, yes, not to orally deduce their chemical structures.
EMILY: Everything has to be at your pace.
LORELAI: Or at a pace that can't be measured by the number of times the earth circles the sun.
SOOKIE: You know, actually, I've heard that.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: One is to acclimate, two is for foundation, and three to judge.
LORELAI: Traitor.
EMILY: The women in my DAR group are very picky. My God, when the pate at the meeting Heddy Cubbington organized was slightly less chilled than appropriate, she was ostracized for a month.
LORELAI: Well, that hussy Heddy had it coming.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: [to employee] Oh, gosh, they're on time for once, good. Hey, do me a favor and, uh, tell Michel that on Wednesday. . .
EMILY: Lorelai, please.
LORELAI: Thanks. Um, Mom, I got a lot of other things happening here that can't come to a grinding halt for this.
EMILY: So your full attention for a short period is too much to ask for?
LORELAI: Mom, I'm already giving you more attention than I would someone in these circumstances. No one else would get eight separate soups to taste for a lousy DAR. . .sorry, a not lousy DAR meeting. We only do this for weddings.
EMILY: Well, would you like me to pay for the tasting?
LORELAI: No, Mom, just decide in this calendar year.
SOOKIE: Hey, can I. . .I'm sorry. The mushroom is a great choice. It's super popular, and it's my Jackson's favorite.
EMILY: Whose?
SOOKIE: Jackson, my fiancé.
EMILY: Oh, you're getting married?
SOOKIE: To the best man in the world.
LORELAI: Oh hey, while we're on the subject, um, bridesmaids outfits?
SOOKIE: Ooh, I'm way ahead of you. I've already got a couple of ideas.
LORELAI: Is one of them having me design and make them so I don't secretly hate what you pick and then harbor a secret grudge against you for the rest of our lives?
SOOKIE: It is now.
LORELAI: I'll do it!
SOOKIE: We're a good team.
MICHEL: That fellow's on the phone from the restaurant.
LORELAI: Who?
MICHEL: The flannel man with the protruding ankles.
LORELAI: Oh, Luke?
MICHEL: I forgot his name from the desk to here, that's how memorable he is.
LORELAI: Okay, thank you.
EMILY: Where are you going?
LORELAI: Oh, to talk to Luke.
EMILY: Can't you call him back?
LORELAI: Have your third taste, Mom. [leaves]
EMILY: Lorelai! Is she always this scattered?
SOOKIE: She's the stablest person I know.
EMILY: That's very sad. Well, I think you're right, mushroom.
SOOKIE: Great.
EMILY: So, tell me more about your wedding.
SOOKIE: Oh, I've just started planning so there's not that much to tell.
EMILY: Well, have you decided on anything yet? The location or the music for the ceremony, maybe?
SOOKIE: Oh, we'll probably just, you know, wind up playing something off a CD.
EMILY: Oh.
SOOKIE: What?
EMILY: Well, CD's can be very unreliable. They break sometimes, or they skip, or the person assigned to turn them on and off gets distracted and the whole ceremony is ruined.
SOOKIE: I hadn't thought of that.
EMILY: Have you thought about live music?
SOOKIE: Well. . .
EMILY: A nice string ensemble.
SOOKIE: Ooh, that sounds nice.
EMILY: There are a couple of wonderful groups I could recommend.
SOOKIE: Sure. I mean, I guess it doesn't hurt to check them out.
EMILY: No, it doesn't. Mushroom soup.
SOOKIE: String quartet.
CUT TO FRONT DESK
[Lorelai walks over and picks up the phone]
LORELAI: Luke?
LUKE: Yeah, hi.
LORELAI: Hello.
LUKE: How's it going?
LORELAI: Pretty good, pretty good. How's things with you?
LUKE: Oh, not bad. Dropped some eggs.
LORELAI: Bummer.
LUKE: Hazard of the business. Am I catching you at a bad time?
LORELAI: Oh, no, it's kind of slow here. So slow, in fact, that Michel and I were about to get the tetherball out.
LUKE: That's the thing with a ball tethered to a rope?
LORELAI: Hey, I never knew that's where the tether comes from.
LUKE: Yeah, it's tethered. It's tied, like an anchor is tethered to a rope on a boat.
LORELAI: Neat, neat.
LUKE: Yeah, most people probably don't put that together.
LORELAI: Probably not.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: So, anything else?
LUKE: Uh, yeah, actually if I needed a room or two for a couple of days, would that be possible?
LORELAI: You need rooms?
LUKE: Like nine.
LORELAI: You need nine rooms?
LUKE: Just for a couple of days, Wednesday and Thursday.
LORELAI: Uh, well, I can take care of that. What's it for?
LUKE: Uh, just got some family coming in.
LORELAI: Reunion? Cause we can get the tetherball out.
LUKE: Nah, funeral.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Yeah, my Uncle Louie died last night and I'm arranging the funeral for him.
LORELAI: Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry. Here I was babbling about tetherball.
LUKE: And you weren't babbling.
LORELAI: Well, you've got nine rooms, Wednesday and Thursday.
LUKE: You sure?
LORELAI: It's a done deal.
LUKE: Thanks.
LORELAI: Luke, I'm so, so sorry.
LUKE: It's okay. It sounds like he went peaceful. He was eighty-five.
LORELAI: But it's always hard. Um, are you okay?
LUKE: Yeah, I'm okay.
LORELAI: Can I help you with anything else?
LUKE: No, the rooms are help enough.
LORELAI: Are you sure, cause I'm dealing with my mom now and I'd be happy to rush over and help with whatever. You'd be doing me a favor.
LUKE: The rooms are all I need, thanks.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
LUKE: Well, I gotta go.
LORELAI: Call if you need anything.
LUKE: I will. By the way, that French guy's a putz.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, he knows.
LUKE: All right, see ya.
LORELAI: Bye.
CUT TO SIDEWALK
[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street towards the diner]
RORY: It's so sad.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Was Luke, like, shaken over his uncle dying?
LORELAI: I don't know. He's so unflappable. It's hard to tell.
RORY: The man definitely can't be flapped.
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory walk through the door. Luke is on the phone while several customers try to get his attention.]
WOMAN: Can I get another cup of coffee?
LUKE: In a minute.
SY: Hey, is that my food?
MAN: More coffee here, too, please.
LUKE: In a minute.
SY: Is that my food?
KIRK: More coffee for me, too.
LUKE: Shut up, Kirk.
SY: Is that my food?
LUKE: Yes, Sy, that's your food.
SY: Well, can I have it?
LUKE: I'm doing all I can here, folks.
KIRK: I asked nicely.
MAN: Hey, hey, watch the cord!
LUKE: Try ducking.
KIRK: You should update to a cordless.
LORELAI: Hey, whatcha doing? Watch, watch it.
LUKE: Ah, buh buh buh. . .thanks, thanks, I'm on the phone.
LORELAI: We noticed.
LUKE: Yeah, I can't serve and be on the phone.
RORY: We noticed that, too.
LORELAI: But your reenactment of Jerry Lewis in The Diner Guy is gonna wow the critics.
RORY: Where should the poached eggs go?
LUKE: Crank in the hat.
SY: Hey, I'm not a crank! You're a crank, crank!
RORY: He is a crank.
LORELAI: And the French toast?
LUKE: Lady with the giant purse. Ah, yup.
MAN: This is not good.
LORELAI: Hey, fall back cowboy.
LUKE: Yo, whoa, whoa, whoa what are you doing?
LORELAI: Come here. Just stay on the phone and give me these. Where do they go?
LUKE: Table by the window.
LORELAI: Don't you number your tables?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: You should number your tables.
LUKE: What good would that do? If I said a number, you wouldn't know what table was what number.
LORELAI: But all restaurants number their table. You should number your tables.
LUKE: Table five, they go to table five.
LORELAI: Cool. Which one is that?
LUKE: Table by the window.
LORELAI: By the window, Elma.
RORY: Got it, Gertie.
KIRK: Hello? How 'bout that coffee?
LORELAI: I got it.
LUKE: Thanks.
KIRK: But, but mine's a quarter caf.
LORELAI: Huh?
KIRK: Three-fourths decaf, one-fourth caffeinated.
LORELAI: I four-fourths don't care.
KIRK: Fill it up.
LUKE: Sorry about this.
LORELAI: It's okay.
LUKE: Sometimes you get the world's full of people who micromanage their lives to the point where they can't wait an extra second for anything.
LORELAI: We're running out of coffee.
LUKE: I'll make some more.
LORELAI: No, I got it.
LUKE: Do you know how?
LORELAI: Do I . . . ugh. . .I am Cathy Coffee, mister, the b*st*rd offspring of Mrs. Folger and Juan Valdez.
RORY: Hey Luke, where's Jess?
LUKE: I don't know.
RORY: School?
LUKE: Please. He's probably upstairs.
RORY: Really? Excuse me.
LUKE: It's too strong.
LORELAI: No, it's not.
LUKE: No, it's too strong.
LORELAI: You're on the phone.
LUKE: Not everybody likes it that strong.
LORELAI: Well, then I shall convert them. I am the Jehovah's coffee girl.
CUT TO UPSTAIRS
[Rory knocks on Luke's apartment door]
RORY: Jess, open up! I know you're in there.
JESS: My, aren't we bright eyed and bushy tailed.
RORY: Luke needs you downstairs.
JESS: Why?
RORY: Because he's on the phone with someone and Caesar's off today and the place is packed and he needs help.
JESS: I'll be down in a minute.
RORY: No, now.
JESS: I'm in the middle of something.
RORY: Just assume that Jeannie's gonna get Major Healey out of whatever scrape he's in.
JESS: Gee, thanks for spoiling it for me.
CUT TO THE DINER
KIRK: I need some more Equal.
LORELAI: There's one right there.
KIRK: I need seven
LORELAI: Seven? You're not squirreling these away in your pocket for home use, are you, Kirk?
KIRK: No, I use seven in my coffee.
LORELAI: Okay, good, then allow me. [pours seven Equals into his cup] There you go. Go ahead and give that a taste, see if it's to your liking.
KIRK: Okay. [takes sip] Perfection.
LORELAI: Good.
[Jess stumbles into the diner, followed by Rory]
LORELAI: Well, you're very graceful.
JESS: She pushed me.
RORY: Sue me.
JESS: I could've broken my neck.
RORY: As long as it's not your arm. We need your arm.
JESS: Despot.
LUKE: Took me twenty minutes to get pass this place's stupid busy signal, then they put me on hold forever.
LORELAI: Who's keeping you on hold?
LUKE: That mortuary in Florida where my uncle's at.
LORELAI: Florida? I thought he was in the area.
LUKE: No no, he spent most of his life here but retired to Orlando, so I gotta ship the body back here.
LORELAI: Aw, he wanted to be buried in Stars Hollow?
LUKE: Nah, my dad wanted my uncle buried in Stars Hollow right next to him.
LORELAI: That's nice.
LUKE: Well, they were really close, and Louie didn't have any wife or kids to look out for things and before my dad died, he asked me if I'd look out for him.
LORELAI: For Louie?
LUKE: Yeah, he just wanted me to make sure he got a proper funeral. You know, respectful, dignified.
LORELAI: No horseshoe carnation wreaths, got it. Good man, that dad of yours.
LUKE: And since Louie's a war veteran, the town Revolutionary War reenactors will attend the service, do the salute thing, you know. I mean, it makes me nauseous, but my dad wanted it. [on phone] Yeah, hi, I'm still here. . .Yes, the deceased is Louie Danes. . .Right. . .No, Hartford's not too far, I can do that. Thanks. [hangs up] Great, that's done. Uh, okay, I should probably go pick out a coffin before he gets here.
LORELAI: Great, go.
LUKE: I have to close up.
LORELAI: No, you don't. You're covered.
LUKE: You don't have to do this.
LORELAI: We don't mind. Go. It'll give me a chance to number all the tables.
LUKE: Be my guest.
LORELAI: Also, are they arranged like this for any particular reason?
LUKE: Don't change anything.
LORELAI: It's totally not feng shui.
LUKE: Gertie.
LORELAI: Go.
CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET
[A customer walks up to Taylor]
MRS. CASSINI: Excuse me, Taylor, where are your Brussels sprouts?
TAYLOR: My supplier was out of them this week, Mrs. Cassini. Maybe next week.
MRS. CASSINI: Oh, I wanted to make them tonight.
TAYLOR: Sorry.
MRS. CASSINI: Okay, I'll just try across the street. Thank you.
TAYLOR: You're welcome. Across the street? [goes outside] What is that?
MRS. CASSINI: It's a farmer's market. Isn't it wonderful? It just opened this morning and. . .I see sprouts!
[Taylor walks over to the farmer's market]
TAYLOR: Who's the proprietor here?
PROPRIETOR: That would be me. What can I do for you?
TAYLOR: Wait a minute, I know you. You're that long-haired freak that wanted to be town troubadour even though that weird brown-corduroy-jacket-wearing freak was already it.
PROPRIETOR: That's right, good memory! How are ya? [hugs him]
TAYLOR: Let go of me!
PROPRIETOR: Don't like to be touched, that's cool. Got a little David and Lisa thing happening? Made a mental note, no problem. Can I help you find something?
TAYLOR: I just want to know what inspired you to open a produce stand right across the street from my market.
PROPRIETOR: Oh, is that your market?
TAYLOR: Yes, that's my market.
PROPRIETOR: Well, it's real nice, homey. Bought a box of tissues there good stuff, good stuff.
MISS PATTY: Excuse me? Your parsley is it priced per bunch or per pound?
PROPRIETOR: Per pound, beautiful.
MISS PATTY: Mmm, good deal.
TAYLOR: Patty!
MISS PATTY: Oh, hi Taylor, how are you?
TAYLOR: You mean not counting the knife sticking in my back?
MISS PATTY: Oh, sure honey, whatever.
TAYLOR: There must be some mistake this just isn't right.
PROPRIETOR: It's all approved by the proper authorities. I followed the rules, it's what my father taught me. Cop for twenty years, got shot in the butt. Good man tips over sometimes when he sits but good man.
MRS. CASSINI: Beautiful sprouts.
PROPRIETOR: For a beautiful lady.
MRS. CASSINI: Thank you.
TAYLOR: I feel sick.
PROPRIETOR: That'll be four dollars. See ya, Mr. Doose.
TAYLOR: I wanna lie down.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Michel is at the front desk as Lorelai walks over]
MICHEL: Ah, Lorelai, good tell me about the nine rooms set aside here. There's no name anywhere that I can see, and no credit card to hold them. Mistake?
LORELAI: No, it's for Luke.
MICHEL: For who?
LORELAI: Luke from Luke's Diner.
MICHEL: Nine rooms for Luke from Luke's Diner?
LORELAI: That's right.
MICHEL: French fry convention?
LORELAI: No, just personal.
MICHEL: Milkshake symposium?
LORELAI: No Michel, it's something personal and I'm vouching for him.
MICHEL: Soda pop seminar?
LORELAI: Stop!
MICHEL: Pickle party?
LORELAI: He's got nine rooms, now stifle.
[Lorelai walks away as Emily enters the inn]
LORELAI: Oh, Mom, hi there.
EMILY: Lorelai, hello.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, did we get our signals crossed? I don't remember making an appointment with you.
EMILY: We have to make appointments to see each other?
LORELAI: No, but good one.
EMILY: I'm not here to see you.
LORELAI: Oh, this isn't about the DAR meeting?
EMILY: No, that's all ready to go. I'm here to meet with Sookie.
LORELAI: Sookie?
EMILY: I'm a little late, traffic was awful. Excuse me, would you?
CUT TO DINING ROOM
[The tables are set with fancy place settings and flowers.]
LORELAI: Oh my God.
SOOKIE: Aren't they beautiful?
LORELAI: Gorgeous. What are they for?
SOOKIE: My wedding.
LORELAI: Your wedding?
SOOKIE: Emily, hi!
EMILY: Well, is this everything I said it was?
SOOKIE: And more.
LORELAI: What do you mean they're for your wedding?
SOOKIE: Oh, it's this company's sample place setting. Emily set me up with them. They did Celine Dion's wedding, and Steven Spielberg's daughter's Jack Russell Terrier's Bark Mitzvah.
LORELAI: You're putting me on.
SOOKIE: I couldn't make that up.
EMILY: Excuse me, this one's slightly asymmetrical. Fix these.
LORELAI: Hey, um, what is with the fancy place settings? I thought you were just gonna keep it simple.
SOOKIE: It is simple.
LORELAI: It lights up.
SOOKIE: Just flip a switch, simple.
LORELAI: Tell me how my mother got so involved in all of this.
SOOKIE: She's not that involved. She just mentioned the other day when she was here that she knew some people that could make some samples of stuff for us, like table settings and flower arrangements.
LORELAI: But we were gonna do the flowers ourselves.
SOOKIE: I know, but what a hassle that would be.
LORELAI: It's to save money flowers cost a fortune.
SOOKIE: Yeah, but, the sampling of what they're doing today it's free. I'm not committed to any of this.
LORELAI: I hope not.
SOOKIE: It's true I say no, it all goes away. Not a penny is spent.
LORELAI: Okay.
SOOKIE: And it's fun.
LORELAI: I don't wanna take away your fun, I just want you to be careful. See, you've entered Emilyland.
SOOKIE: Emilyland?
LORELAI: It's an upside down world where the Horchow House is considered low-rent and diamonds less than twenty-four carats are Cracker Jack trinkets and Bentleys are for losers who can't afford a Rolls.
SOOKIE: But I'm okay, really.
LORELAI: All right. I have to help Luke with the lunch rush today, so I gotta go.
SOOKIE: Go, we're fine.
LORELAI: Okay. Bye Mom.
EMILY: [picks up a glass] Is that a fingerprint? My God, that's a fingerprint! Who touched this? Let me see your hands!
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Taylor is sitting at a table mumbling to himself as Rory walks by]
TAYLOR: Turnips, turnips, turnips. . .
RORY: What?
TAYLOR: Huh?
RORY: What about turnips?
TAYLOR: Why did you say turnips?
RORY: Because you said turnips.
TAYLOR: No, I didn't.
RORY: I think you did.
TAYLOR: Nope.
RORY: Okay.
TAYLOR: But I've got turnips good ones, too. They're not as big as that crinite freak's turnips, but who needs bloated turnips? Mine are unassuming. I have nice, humble turnips.
RORY: Okie dokie. [walks to the counter] Taylor's wigging.
LORELAI: I know. He's been sitting there like the final days of d!ck Nixon for almost an hour.
RORY: Keep an eye on him.
[a customer walks in and sits at the counter]
LORELAI: Hello there, how's it going?
CUSTOMER: Very good, young lady. You're still serving breakfast?
LORELAI: We serve it all day. What'll you have?
CUSTOMER: Two eggs up on toast.
LORELAI: Up, huh?
CUSTOMER: Yup.
LORELAI: Wouldn't you rather have them scrambled?
CUSTOMER: Nope, up's how I like them.
LORELAI: Come on, scrambled's better. Give it a shot. Say you want two scrambled eggs on toast, please?
CUSTOMER: Okay, young lady, two scrambled eggs on toast.
LORELAI: Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck them! That's real live diner talk, see? The wreck them is the scrambled part.
CUSTOMER: I deduced that.
TAYLOR: I don't believe it, I don't believe it!
LORELAI: What's the matter?
TAYLOR: That's Babette with an armload of rutabagas, and there's Miss Patty again since when does she eat so much fruit?
[Kirk enters the diner]
LORELAI: Hey Kirk.
KIRK: Hello. Where's Luke?
LORELAI: Oh, he's busy with some stuff so Rory and I are helping out. What can I get you?
KIRK: I don't know. I want lunch, but I'm not sure what to get.
LORELAI: I have a suggestion. How about a hamburger with some strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert?
KIRK: Sounds good.
LORELAI: Yo, burn one, then pass me a pink stick and throw some mud on it! God, I love this business.
[The proprietor of the farmer's market enters the diner]
PROPRIETOR: Boy, it's freezing out there.
LORELAI: Yes, it's quite a cold snap. How bout a hot blonde with sand?
PROPRIETOR: Coffee with cream and sugar would be great, thanks. Make sure its' foot's out the door.
LORELAI: Put it in a cup to go, got it.
PROPRIETOR: This icy weather hasn't kept customers away, though. They just keep coming. A lot of vegetable soup being eaten tonight, yesiree. Hope I don't put the good people at Campbell's out of business. Oh, hey Taylor. Didn't notice you there.
TAYLOR: Hello.
PROPRIETOR: Taking a little break? I don't see how if you're anywhere near as busy as I am. Keep waiting for a lull, I never get one. I say to the people, hey, I'll be back in a jif' and they're look at them they're lining up out there already.
TAYLOR: Well, FYI, Van Halen hair, I'm plenty busy, but a good well-groomed businessman with properly prepared staff can take a break now and then.
KIRK: It probably helped that your store was completely dead, too.
TAYLOR: It was not dead.
KIRK: I thought it was closed when I walked by, but then I saw Gabby sitting at the cash register reading a tabloid.
TAYLOR: Shut up, Kirk.
KIRK: Tapping on the counter with one of those little astrological scrolls.
TAYLOR: Enough.
LORELAI: Here you go.
PROPRIETOR: Gracias. Oh boy, it's a mob scene. [leaves]
CUT TO UPSTAIRS
[Lorelai knocks on Luke's apartment door]
LORELAI: Luke, it's me.
[Luke opens the door]
LORELAI: Hey. I brought you a wimpy with a rose pinned on it.
LUKE: A what?
LORELAI: Turkey burger with onions.
LUKE: Oh, thanks. Come on in.
LORELAI: How's the money pit coming?
LUKE: Oh, just uh. . .that's it.
LORELAI: What's the matter?
LUKE: Nothing. None of them are coming not a one.
LORELAI: Who?
LUKE: My relatives the ones I booked all the rooms for not one is coming to Louie's funeral.
LORELAI: You're kidding why?
LUKE: I don't know, which lame-o excuse do you wanna hear first? A bunch of them claimed they can't get outta work.
LORELAI: It's not so lame-o.
LUKE: Randy and Barbara don't wanna miss their brat kid's rugby semifinal.
LORELAI: Rugby has semifinals?
LUKE: My sister never even called back. My cousins Paul and Jim, who my dad helped put through college, said they were too exhausted from a fishing trip. And slightly disturbed cousin Franny said she can't leave because her Petey's sick.
LORELAI: Son?
LUKE: Parrot.
LORELAI: Petey the parrot?
LUKE: I saw the stupid thing once on a visit, flapping its wings like crazy, banging around, squawking the only two words it knows over and over Petey and gorgeous. Gorgeous, Petey, gorgeous, Petey!
LORELAI: That's disturbing.
LUKE: My family's disturbing.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry.
LUKE: This is wrong, this is not how it's done. A family member dies, you pay your respects period.
LORELAI: Look at it this way if they don't wanna be there, you don't want them there.
LUKE: My dad wanted them to be there.
LORELAI: I know. But hey, Louie lived in Stars Hollow most of his life, so a lot of people from here will be there, right?
LUKE: Right.
LORELAI: I know it's upsetting, but maybe it's better this way.
LUKE: Yeah, I guess. I really hate that bird.
[Rory walks into the apartment]
RORY: Hey Mom?
LORELAI: What's up, honey? You got a herd of bulls shopping for China?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Customers how long have you owned a diner?
RORY: Sorry. Jackson's outside, he wants to talk to you, he says it's important.
LORELAI: About what?
RORY: I don't know. He seems upset.
LORELAI: Ah. All right. You okay?
LUKE: Yeah, thanks.
LORELAI: You might wanna study up on that diner talk.
LUKE: I'll do that tonight.
RORY: Hey Luke, where's Jess?
LUKE: I don't know, he's probably out playing basketball or something.
RORY: That little punk.
CUT TO DINER
[Lorelai walks down from upstairs and stops at the counter to help a customer]
LORELAI: Oh, hey, uh, can I take your order?
CUSTOMER: Yes, uh, bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, no mayo.
LORELAI: Yo, uh, I need a piggy piggy with a green bla. . .uh, green bed, green blanket. . . BLT, no mayo! Rats.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai walks out of the diner over to Jackson]
LORELAI: Jackson?
JACKSON: I'm a miserable man.
LORELAI: What's up?
JACKSON: Remember that sweet, simple, affordable little wedding Sookie and I agreed on with minimal disagreement no disagreement, in fact perhaps the first time in the history of wedding planning that a couple agreed one hundred percent on everything?
LORELAI: Yes.
JACKSON: Gone. Ancient history. It's the Library of Alexandria, it's the Colossus of Roads, it's Pop Rocks, it's over, and do you know why?
LORELAI: My mother?
JACKSON: Look! [points to Sookie and Emily near the gazebo]
LORELAI: What are they doing?
JACKSON: They're measuring the town.
LORELAI: They're what?
JACKSON: They're measuring the entire town with tape measures.
LORELAI: Oh my God.
JACKSON: Your mother got hers at Neiman Marcus. It's platinum with gold leaf it costs more than my car!
LORELAI: I am so sorry.
JACKSON: Look, I love Sookie and I want her to have what she wants, but . . . you see what they're doing now?
LORELAI: Yeah.
JACKSON: According to their diagrams, that's where the sixteen-piece orchestra goes.
LORELAI: How are they gonna fit a sixteen-piece orchestra in the gazebo?
JACKSON: Oh, they wanna move the gazebo.
LORELAI: What?
JACKSON: A gazebo that's been there for a hundred years and they wanna move it. Who moves a gazebo? What kind of twisted mind even thinks about moving a gazebo?
LORELAI: Okay, I'll take care of this.
JACKSON: She's so excited.
LORELAI: She's brainwashed. She's Patricia Hearst and my mother is the SLA.
JACKSON: I just hope it's not too late.
LORELAI: I hope so, too.
[Rory walks by, pulling Jess behind her]
JESS: Watch the shirt!
RORY: Cork it!
CUT TO THE DANCE STUDIO
[Taylor is at the podium leading a town meeting]
MISS PATTY: Well, it seems the right thing to do, Taylor.
TAYLOR: I concur. When one gazes at Stars Hollow, one can easily overlook a vital component of its beauty and that's the humble yet spunky twinkle light.
JESS: Holy cow.
LUKE: It doesn't get fruitier.
TAYLOR: Harry's House of Twinkle Lights has been an integral part of this time for twenty years, so it's only right that we honor his retirement. So I hereby designate next Tuesday, Harry the Twinkle Light Man from Harry's House of Twinkle Lights Day.
JESS: Well, that just trips off the tongue.
[Lorelai and Rory walk in]
TAYLOR: Late again, are we?
LORELAI: Yes, I hope I'm not pregnant!
TAYLOR: What?
LORELAI: Are these seats taken?
LUKE: Don't drag me into this.
TAYLOR: You really have to work on your punctuality, Lorelai. I banged the meeting in a half an hour ago.
LORELAI: Uh, dirty!
TAYLOR: I'm gonna take advantage of this unexpected pause in our proceedings to confer with Miss Patty about the next item on our agenda.
LORELAI: What'd we miss?
LUKE: Harry's retiring.
RORY: The twinkle light man?
LORELAI: What do we do for twinkle lights?
LUKE: Go to any discount store?
LORELAI: Blasphemy.
RORY: What are you doing here anyhow? This is a town meeting for people who participate in and care about the town.
JESS: Well, Corky's Country Cavalcade on public access was pre-empted, so I thought I'd check out the next best thing.
LORELAI: I'm surprised you have time to be here.
LUKE: I don't, but I haven't been able to get any of the war reenactors on the phone and I have to confirm them for Louie's funeral.
TAYLOR: All right now, the last order of business is a matter relating personally to me, therefore I'm going to give Miss Patty my gavel.
LORELAI: Again, dirty!
TAYLOR: Stop that. Now don't go power mad.
MISS PATTY: Oh, all right, gee. Now the chair recognizes Taylor Doose. Taylor, you have the floor.
TAYLOR: Thank you, Patty. My issue, ladies and gentlemen, is in the form of a grievance against this hirsute hippie who opened a produce stand in the park.
BABETTE: Oh yeah, killer veggies.
SY: Tasty.
MISS PATTY: The squash is beautiful.
BABETTE: Sexy it's sexy squash.
TAYLOR: Sexy or not, I demand that this man produce his permit post haste.
PROPRIETOR: Got it right here.
TAYLOR: Mm hmm, just what I thought. This is not the proper permit for this kind of business. This is a type twenty-four B, otherwise known as a cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk permit. This is not valid for your business.
PROPRIETOR: Why'd you say it twice?
TAYLOR: Hmm?
BABETTE: You said cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk.
LORELAI: It's repetitive.
RORY: And redundant.
LORELAI: It's repetitive.
RORY: And redundant.
LORELAI: We certainly are entertaining, Mac.
RORY: Indubitably, Tosh.
TAYLOR: It's not redundant. It's three separate things. It's a cart, a kiosk, and a mechanical hybrid referred to as a cart-slash-kiosk, hence cart, kiosk, cart/kiosk.
BABETTE: He did it again.
KIRK: He's been stressed lately. His store is deserted.
TAYLOR: I'll make it simple. This is for businesses that roll in in the morning and roll out at night. Emphasis on the word roll rolling businesses, businesses that roll.
PROPRIETOR: But I carry my tables out at night.
TAYLOR: But you're supposed to roll them, Rapunzel, and carrying isn't rolling, is it? I mean, did anyone hear the word rolling come out of his mouth? Check the transcript, I think you'll find one word missing rolling!
MISS PATTY: Transcript?
LORELAI: Yeah, Taylor, this isn't Charlie Rose.
BABETTE: He's losing his marbles.
ANDREW: It's just a personal vendetta.
KIRK: His store is deserted.
MISS PATTY: I think that we should end the meeting right here, Taylor.
TAYLOR: Wait a second, wait a second! You there, when Lady Godiva here wanted to be town troubadour over you, I stood by your side. Why aren't you backing me now?
TROUBADOUR: Cause you left me twistin' for a long time before you did, Taylor, and it didn't feel good. I even wrote a song about the experience.
LORELAI: Oh, I heard it. It's called "Taylor Left Me Twistin'."
RORY: Oh yeah, it's really good.
TROUBADOUR: You think? Because I'm having a little trouble with the chorus. Taylor left me twistin', he set my eyes a mistin'. I'm just not sure if it has that thing, though, you know?
LORELAI: Oh, no, I love that part. I actually thought that maybe at the end you could do more about the sweater. We'll talk.
MISS PATTY: I'm gonna wrap this up.
TAYLOR: Now, Patty, how would you feel if this guy decided to open the long-haired freak school of dance or the long-haired freak diner, Luke? Or the long-haired freak bookstore? It's not good, right?
MISS PATTY: All right, everybody who agrees that we would not feel good about that, say aye.
ALL: Aye!
MISS PATTY: Meeting adjourned, goodnight.
LORELAI: Another fun one!
LUKE: Taylor, hold on a sec!
RORY: [to Jess] Don't you have some cleaning up to do over at the diner?
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[As people exit the meeting, Luke runs over to Taylor and the other reenactors]
LUKE: Guys, hold it, come on, you heard me calling you, stop!
TAYLOR: What is it, Luke?
LUKE: What do you mean, what is it? My Uncle Louie's funeral is tomorrow afternoon and I haven't heard from any of you. The man was a World War II veteran, that's what you reenactor freaks do you go to vet's funerals, so you're gonna be there, right? Hello?
TAYLOR: You said you were gonna talk to him, Sy.
SY: Bert said he was gonna do it.
BERT: It's Taylor's job.
SY: You always pass the buck.
LUKE: Talk to me about what, guys?
TAYLOR: You might as well know, Luke. We don't wanna go to Louie's funeral.
LUKE: What?
ANDREW: We all hated Louie.
LUKE: Oh, come on, that's not true.
TAYLOR: He always had a scowl on his face, not a kind word for anybody. He would light those hideous cigars, blow smoke in people's faces and then spit after each puff.
SY: He was disgusting.
ANDREW: And mean.
KIRK: He kicked my dog when I was a kid.
SY: He hit on my wife repeatedly.
KIRK: Toto was always different after that.
SY: My wife was much affected as well.
KIRK: I'd toss her something to fetch and she'd start to run after it and halfway there she'd forget what she was doing.
SY: She never enjoyed her soap operas the same after that.
KIRK: She'd just lie down and go to sleep.
LUKE: This is an exaggeration.
BERT: We're not exaggerating. We threw a big party when he left town!
SY: I made love to my life that night like I never have.
KIRK: My Toto barked a happy bark, then quietly stopped breathing. She was old.
LUKE: I don't believe this.
ANDREW: Come on, Luke. You knew the guy.
LUKE: This man was my uncle, okay, and a war veteran. He deserves a veteran's funeral, but hey, if you guys are too lazy to show up, then. . .
TAYLOR: He's the lazy one. Never once did he participate in a town function. In fact, when we reenactors gathered, he'd throw things at us.
SY: And not soft things, hard things.
BERT: Rocks, and small tools.
LUKE: Okay, I've heard enough.
SY: And he got meaner as he got older. Never married, never had kids.
BERT: A real loner.
LUKE: To hell with you guys, who needs you! I might just throw rocks and small tools at you myself next time I see ya!
TAYLOR: A defensive hothead, just like Louie!
BERT: They're practically clones.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Sookie is sitting in front of a computer and Michel is looking over her shoulder as Lorelai walks in]
SOOKIE: Oh my God, this is so hi-tech.
LORELAI: Hey. What's going on?
SOOKIE: I'm downloading wedding stuff from Prague.
LORELAI: Oh, you're kidding.
SOOKIE: It's streaming in right now. That's Internet talk streaming. Did you know that? And did you know it's not called Czechoslovakia anymore? It's just Czech Republic. Slovakia is its own separate thing. It's weird, isn't it? It's like if we just suddenly started saying there's no more Connecticut, it's just Connec. . . Ticut.
LORELAI: Sookie, what are you downloading from Prague?
MICHEL: Oh, this will much amuse you.
SOOKIE: Color samples for the big ceramic stands.
LORELAI: Big ceramic stands for what?
SOOKIE: For the giant papier-mâché mushrooms.
LORELAI: What are the papier-mâché mushrooms for?
SOOKIE: For the midgets dressed like angels to dance under, silly.
LORELAI: Oh my God.
SOOKIE: Emily found the best papier-mâché mushroom maker in Paris. He's much better than the guy that makes them in Belgium what a hack.
LORELAI: Sookie, honey, I need you stop staring and streaming for one second. We need to talk.
MICHEL: Please, please do not talk her out of these things. I do not want to die without seeing midgets dancing with a mushroom.
LORELAI: Stay out of this.
MICHEL: Oh, you're no fun.
SOOKIE: What is it honey?
LORELAI: The danger of Emilyworld is that you don't always know you're in it, when actually you are.
SOOKIE: Aw, not this Emilyworld stuff again
LORELAI: Sookie, have you run the numbers on any of this? What is this costing you?
SOOKIE: I don't know the full cost but your mother is getting me fifty percent off everything. She is so connected.
LORELAI: Okay, but fifty percent off a load of money is still half a load of money. You don't have half a load to spend.
SOOKIE: Well, if I scrimp I can afford a quarter load.
LORELAI: That's still too much.
SOOKIE: Well, your mother said she'd chip in a little.
LORELAI: Sookie, that is way, way, way inappropriate.
SOOKIE: I didn't take her up on it but it was nice.
LORELAI: Sookie, this isn't you, the midgets and the mushrooms and God knows what else. And it isn't Jackson either.
SOOKIE: What do you mean?
LORELAI: We talked.
SOOKIE: You and Jackson talked?
LORELAI: I'm sorry but he came to me all upset, and I love you Sookie and I love him too and it just seemed like it was time for me to meddle.
SOOKIE: He was upset?
LORELAI: He was pretty upset.
SOOKIE: Why didn't he just talk to me?
LORELAI: Because he's Jackson, he wants you to be happy and to give you everything you want. So what it comes down to is is this what you want?
SOOKIE: Well, maybe the midgets are a little over the top. And the mushrooms. . . oh my God, it's all sounding so silly now.
LORELAI: You're coming out of it, keep going.
SOOKIE: No, no, it's not what I want! We were supposed to keep this nice and simple. God, we had it all worked out.
LORELAI: So go back.
SOOKIE: I will go back. That is, if Jackson still wants to marry me.
LORELAI: Of course he still wants to marry you.
SOOKIE: I'm gonna call him and I'm gonna tell him it's all changing back.
LORELAI: Good.
[Lorelai's cell phone rings]
SOOKIE: Ooh, I should call and cancel some stuff first. I've gotta call Belgium and Oslo and, uh, oh, Copenhagen, Bora Bora.
LORELAI: What did you order from there?
SOOKIE: I'm gonna shield you from that one.
LORELAI: Thanks. [answers phone] Hello?. . .Luke!. . . Slow down, slow down. . . Okay, I'll come right over. [hangs up] I gotta go. Call, call, and welcome back, friend.
SOOKIE: Thanks. Ooh, I'm gonna start with Hong Kong. I'm hoping those acrobats can get another gig.
CUT TO FUNERAL HOME
[Luke is waiting impatiently near a casket as Lorelai walks in]
LORELAI: There you are. What .
LUKE: It won't close.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: The lid.
LORELAI: To what? [sees casket] Oh, hello. . . Louie.
LUKE: That's Louie.
LORELAI: Nice tan. So, now, you say the lid won't close?
LUKE: Yes, the lid won't close.
LORELAI: Did you buy the right size?
LUKE: Of course I bought the right size.
FUNERAL DIRECTOR: It's the model we recommend for those of medium height and weight.
LUKE: And he's of medium height and weight.
LORELAI: So then why won't it close?
LUKE: Because of the stuff.
LORELAI: What stuff?
LUKE: The stuff. He left a list of stuff he wanted buried with him.
FUNERAL DIRECTOR: It's not uncommon.
LUKE: It's a very long list. His fishing reel, bowling trophy, a flask, his antique dueling pistols, his copy of Sherman's Memoirs.
LORELAI: So is all the stuff in there now?
LUKE: Yes, it is. I shoved it in the best I could but now it won't close which defeats the entire purpose of having a damn casket in the first place.
LORELAI: May I?
LUKE: Give it a shot.
[Lorelai tries to push the lid close, but it pops back up]
LORELAI: Whoa!
LUKE: The football signed by Johnny Unitas gives it that bounce.
LORELAI: What if we moved the gas mask and the pith helmet down towards the feet?
LUKE: That end already has every baseball card he ever bought, thousands of them.
LORELAI: Oh, bungee cord! No. Um, what if we got some people from the office here, you know, accounting or whatever, to sit on the lid and then we could latch it? Do you have anybody you could spring. . .hm. I'm out of ideas.
LUKE: So am I. You know what, to hell with this. To hell with this!
LORELAI: Luke, now come on.
LUKE: I can't deal with this anymore!
LORELAI: Well, it has to be dealt with.
LUKE: No, it doesn't. It's not as if he deserves my help or my respect.
LORELAI: The man was your uncle.
LUKE: He was a jerk!
LORELAI: Don't say that.
LUKE: No, no, Taylor and the guys were right. I was cutting Louie slack out of respect for my dad, but the man was rotten and mean and selfish all his life. For God's sake, he's even selfish in death. Other people would've loved to have had those baseball cards. I would've loved to have those baseball cards. He's got Lou Gehrig's rookie card, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, tons of others but no! My uncle, King Tut, has to take all of them to the afterlife with him!
FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Sir, your voice.
LUKE: I'm done, I've had it. From now on, it's just the bare minimum and that's it. Dig a big hole and just dump the casket in unlatched. If stuff falls out, fine. Just pile on enough dirt and make sure nothing's showing! [leaves]
LORELAI: I'm assuming that wouldn't be appropriate either?
FUNERAL DIRECTOR: No.
LORELAI: I didn't think so.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Jess is walking around the tables refilling coffee]
CUSTOMER: Young man, where's the young lady we've heard so much about who's using those delightful old diner phrases to place people's orders? It sounds so fun. Could you point her out for us?
JESS: No. [walks to counter] That's everyone. I'll be upstairs.
RORY: Thanks for doing the very least you could possibly do.
JESS: You're welcome.
[Luke enters the diner]
LORELAI: Luke, there you are. I was worried.
LUKE: Yeah, sorry, I should've called. Thanks for covering again. This'll be the last time, I promise.
LORELAI: It's okay. Where were you?
LUKE: Well, at first, I walked around a bunch, ya know, just trying to clear my head. Saw a lot of Hartford and what a cesspool.
LORELAI: Well, you're not a city man.
LUKE: Then I calmed down after awhile and I figured dumping Louie's body in an open grave with all his stuff probably would be a little cold.
LORELAI: Just a tad.
LUKE: So I got a Yellow Pages and I found the Big and Tall Casket Shop in Hartford.
LORELAI: You're kidding.
LUKE: Nope, I found a casket that would fit my hundred and sixty pound uncle and his hundred and forty pounds of stuff, got the lid to shut the first time we tried it, so the funeral's on as scheduled.
LORELAI: Good.
LUKE: I still don't know why I'm doing this.
LORELAI: You're doing it for your dad.
LUKE: Yeah, I guess. Although he's dead so he'd never know if I was doing it any different.
LORELAI: He knows. He's got the big Luke picture screen on twenty four hours a day and he watches and smiles. And you're doing it cause you're you.
LUKE: Hey, I'm gonna change real fast and you can retire from your diner career forever.
LORELAI: Oh no, it's fun. I came up with some new diner phrases. Do you know what a Lucky Duck Cluck is?
LUKE: Not offhand.
LORELAI: It's foie gras with chicken and green shamrock frosting.
LUKE: Why would anyone ever order that?
LORELAI: If they're high. [sees Emily enter the diner] Ugh, good grief.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Bad vibe sandwich just came in, better retreat.
LUKE: I won't be long. [goes upstairs]
LORELAI: Hi Mom.
EMILY: Since when do you work here?
LORELAI: I'm just lending a hand. What's going on?
EMILY: I went by the inn to work with Sookie on her wedding.
LORELAI: Yeah?
EMILY: And she fired me.
LORELAI: I'm sure she didn't fire you.
EMILY: She claims to have changed her mind on all the things we had planned.
LORELAI: Well, maybe she did.
EMILY: No, she didn't. I know what's behind this. That is, who's behind this.
LORELAI: Mom, it was getting to be too much for her and too much for her fiancé.
EMILY: I knew it.
LORELAI: Mom, these are not wealthy people, do you understand that? They're saving for a home and your midgets were dancing between them and their dreams.
EMILY: You say midgets like it's so absurd.
LORELAI: Do you hear yourself?
EMILY: I don't see what was so wrong with my just helping Sookie plan her wedding.
LORELAI: Mom, come on.
EMILY: What, come on?
LORELAI: You weren't planning Sookie's wedding.
EMILY: Well, then, whose wedding was I planning?
LORELAI: Mine.
EMILY: Don't be ridiculous.
LORELAI: Mom, your vision for this wedding and all the over the top stuff and the gazillion dollar flowers and bunting and champagne fountain and the Haute Couture dress who's wearing that wedding dress in your mind's eye, Mom? Is it Sookie or is it me?
EMILY: I wasn't planning your wedding, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Right.
EMILY: The wedding I was planning was for Sookie. The mushrooms and colors, they all seemed like fun. A little crazy, just like she is. It definitely was not for you.
LORELAI: Okay Mom.
EMILY: I know that in a million years, you would never let me plan your wedding. I gave up on that dream a long time ago. Yours was going to be a Russian winter theme the Romanovs.
LORELAI: Before the firing squad, I assume?
EMILY: Snow white roses, trees with white lights and candles, snow everywhere, you arriving in a silver sleigh with white horses.
LORELAI: Wow.
EMILY: You hate the idea.
LORELAI: No, no, I just .
EMILY: You just hate it.
LORELAI: No, it just doesn't seem like me.
EMILY: Yes, well, it would've been beautiful.
LORELAI: I'm sure it would've been.
EMILY: Anyhow, it's obvious that wouldn't even be appropriate anymore being as I'm probably standing in your reception hall.
LORELAI: Excuse me?
EMILY: Burgers and fries for the dinner? The bride walks down the aisle with a ketchup dispenser in her hand.
LORELAI: Please tell me what you're talking about.
EMILY: I'm talking about Luke.
LORELAI: Luke? Mom!
EMILY: Well, it's obvious, Lorelai.
LORELAI: No, it's not, Mom.
EMILY: You're with him constantly.
LORELAI: He feeds me.
EMILY: You bring up his name constantly.
LORELAI: Once again, he feeds me.
EMILY: The moment he calls, you run to his side.
LORELAI: He's my friend, he needed me, I had to be there.
EMILY: Yes, I know you did.
[Luke comes down the stairs and walks over to them]
LUKE: Hi.
EMILY: Hello. I have to go. I'll see you for dinner tonight, Lorelai. And Luke, I'm sure I'll see you again soon. What do you think of the Romanovs?
LUKE: They probably had it coming.
EMILY: A match made in heaven.
CUT TO CEMETERY
[Lorelai and Luke are alone at the funeral]
REVEREND: We're here, of course, to honor Louie, to pay our respects and to bid him a sorrowful goodbye.
LORELAI: Are you okay?
LUKE: Yeah. I'm not big on funerals in general.
LORELAI: Nobody is.
REVEREND: He passed away in his sleep, so the end came peacefully for Louie, which I'm sure is a great comfort to all who knew him.
LUKE: The passing away part was a great comfort for all who knew him.
REVEREND: I didn't know him.
LUKE: Good thing.
REVEREND: But I understand he was a fine man, destined to be missed by many.
LUKE: Especially ones that were suing him.
LORELAI: Stop. Sorry father.
REVEREND: Reverend.
LORELAI: Right.
REVEREND: Now let us witness Louie Danes as he is interred and brought to the Lord.
LORELAI: It was a nice service. Nice and, um, intimate.
LUKE: I guess everybody deserves something at the end. Thanks for coming.
LORELAI: I wouldn't have missed it.
LUKE: That ain't me, is it?
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
LUKE: What Taylor said about me being like Louie, a loner, never being married and stuff. I mean, I am getting crankier as I get older, he's not so far off.
LORELAI: You are not your uncle. I mean, would Louie ever build someone a chuppah, or help fix things around someone's house without being asked, or make a special coffee cake with balloons for a girl's sixteenth birthday?
LUKE: Rory told you about that?
LORELAI: Yes. And would Louie have taken in his sister's kid without hesitating and without asking for anything in return?
LUKE: No one would've trusted Louie with their kid. He probably would've forgotten to feed him or something.
LORELAI: You get my point?
LUKE: Yeah, I get it. [he hears drumming] What's that? [he sees one of the reenactors walking onto the cemetery] Is that Andrew?
LORELAI: I believe it is.
[the other reenactors arrive]
LUKE: That's all of them.
[The reenactors start doing their salute]
LUKE: Thanks.
LORELAI: It's what your dad wanted.
LUKE: Yeah. Oh, I know Louie would've hated this.
LORELAI: That's just a fringe benefit.
CUT TO SIDEWALK
[Luke and Lorelai are walking toward the diner]
LORELAI: Do you think he's in heaven?
LUKE: I hope so, just so my dad can kick his butt around the place.
LORELAI: Can you kick when you're in heaven?
LUKE: It's probably frowned upon.
LORELAI: Yeah, plus you're all see-through and gauzy and your dad's foot could go right through him.
LUKE: This is a silly conversation. What's all this?
LORELAI: I have no idea.
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER
[Luke and Lorelai walk into the diner, which is packed with people]
LORELAI: Hi.
LUKE: What's going on?
RORY: It's kind of like a wake.
LUKE: A wake?
LORELAI: For Louie?
RORY: I thought you set it up
LORELAI: I didn't set it up.
RORY: Well, it's going well, anyway. People brought a ton of food if you're hungry.
LORELAI: Huh.
LUKE: This is unexpected.
LORELAI: Very.
LUKE: Don't you have wakes for people you like?
LORELAI: I think it might be for you.
LUKE: Am I dead?
LORELAI: Face it, Luke, people like you.
LUKE: Shut up.
LORELAI: And with charm like that, how can they resist?
[The farmer's market proprietor walks up to Taylor]
PROPRIETOR: Hey Taylor, cool threads. Very "One if By Land."
TAYLOR: Mm hmm.
PROPRIETOR: I see you're digging into the vegetables.
TAYLOR: Thanks for the play by play.
PROPRIETOR: Brought those myself. Hey, how was the funeral?
TAYLOR: Shouldn't you be tending to your little stand out there, friend?
PROPRIETOR: Oh, the stand's gone.
TAYLOR: What?
PROPRIETOR: It's gone, I'm all packed up, I'm outta here.
TAYLOR: I don't get it.
PROPRIETOR: I just grow all that stuff in my back yard and as of yesterday, sold it all.
TAYLOR: You sold it all?
PROPRIETOR: Sold it all, made enough money to do some traveling. Have you ever been to Israel? Turbulent, I know, but I thought I'd go down and try to plant some peace down there, know what I mean? See if it grows and see if it spreads.
TAYLOR: Shut up. Why did you put me through all that hoohah at the town meeting if your vegetable business was just temporary?
PROPRIETOR: Actually, you put yourself through it, Taylor. You put yourself through it.
[Rory walks over to Jess]
RORY: Nice spread.
JESS: People have too much free time in this town.
RORY: You did a good thing.
JESS: What do you mean?
RORY: I thought my mom set this up. Turns out she didn't.
JESS: So? Wasn't me.
RORY: It wasn't?
JESS: Nah, no way. It wasn't me.
RORY: If you say so.
JESS: Look, the crazy ballet teacher called and asked when Luke was getting back from the funeral, if I could unlock the door. I came down, I unlocked the door, then went back upstairs and back to sleep.
RORY: So you did do a little something.
JESS: I unlocked the door.
RORY: So that people could come in here and put this together. Nice.
JESS: Nice for them, not for me.
RORY: You facilitated it, you made it happen, so I guess that means that you're officially apart of our town now.
JESS: Hey, wait a minute.
RORY: Welcome.
JESS: I am not part of this town.
RORY: See you for some tree planting over at the Arbor Day Festival, buddy.
JESS: Yeah, well maybe I can knock over a liquor store while everyone else is planting those stupid trees.
RORY: As long as it's a liquor store in town, neighbor.
[Rory walks over to a table where people are telling stories about Louie]
SY: So, like I say, it's Halloween, right, and we're lucky Louie doesn't have razor wire around his yard, you know how he is. So finally one of the neighborhood kids, he gets all courageous and he goes sauntering up to the door and he goes trick or treat!' Louie finally throws the door open, looks at him and says, Did you get a Reese's cup tonight?' And the kid looks in his bag and he says, Yes sir, I did.' So Louie grabs it, says thank you very much!,' then slams the door in his face.
LORELAI: I'm sorry I never met him.
LUKE: He was colorful.
KIRK: I never trick or treated again.
MISS PATTY: So one day I'm at the post office, I'm in line when Louie just about knocks me over and he cuts in line. I said, Louie, there's a line!' So he says, Kiss my butt!' and I said, You mind your manners!' and he says, Please kiss my butt!' and drops his pants!
BABETTE: Oh, I got one, I got one. Louie was parked outside Al's Pancake World, and I was trying to pull in the space behind him, when all of a sudden, he starts to back up, so I honk my horn and he it was just a little honk, no big deal but he . . .

OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]
RORY: Where is this place?
LORELAI: It's not too far.
RORY: You've been saying that for miles.
LORELAI: It has not been miles.
RORY: My feet are sore.
LORELAI: Hey, Tonto, when did you become older than me?
RORY: Just tell me what this new breakfast place is and then I'll be quiet.
LORELAI: It's an amazing new mystery place that I found and that's all I'm telling ya.
RORY: Just tell me if it's in this town or the next.
LORELAI: We don't patronize the next town.
RORY: Since when?
LORELAI: I don't know, didn't they feed lead to our jumping frog or something?
RORY: Oh yeah, right after they stoned the woman who won the lottery.
LORELAI: See, so the boycott's legit.
LANE: [runs up behind them] Hey, wait, stop!
LORELAI: Oh look, it's Michael Landon.
LANE: Oh my God, you guys walk fast. I've been chasing you for the past two blocks.
RORY: Hey, we were being followed.
LORELAI: I told you I wasn't just being paranoid. Maybe next time you'll take me seriously when I tell you furniture moved itself.
LANE: Where are you guys going?
RORY: Mystery breakfast.
LANE: Out of town?
LORELAI: Does no one remember the definition of the word mystery?
LANE: Sorry, I was just wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again this morning?
LORELAI: It's not like they have any other use.
LANE: Thanks. I've almost nailed the fill in the Ramble On. I just have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull my arms back.
RORY: John Bonham had that same problem.
LORELAI: Key's in the turtle.
LANE: Enjoy your mystery breakfast. [walks away]
LORELAI: Come on, it's not much farther.
RORY: We're not heading toward any businesses of any kind. [Lorelai stops walking] What?
LORELAI: We have arrived.
RORY: Arrived where? [looks up] Aw, you are without shame.
CUT TO INSIDE SOOKIE'S HOUSE
[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the table as Sookie serves them breakfast]
RORY: Sookie, you do not have to do this.
SOOKIE: What do you mean? Feeding my girls, making them happy, I love doing this.
LORELAI: Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt.
RORY: It makes me feel guilty.
LORELAI: Eating can help drown that.
SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah, eat, eat. I'm gonna eat.
RORY: Gee, can the help sit at the table too?
LORELAI: As long as they don't sing folk songs or tell bawdy stories. Hey, what's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?
[Jackson, who is leaning against the counter with his eyes closed, moans]
SOOKIE: He's not much of a morning person.
[Jackson moans]
LORELAI: Now say, I can't believe I ate the whole thing.'
SOOKIE: It takes him about an hour to become Jackson.
[Jackson moans]
LORELAI: Ooh, hey, I had a good idea for the wedding.
SOOKIE: Cool.
LORELAI: Instead of those little wrapped things with Jordan Almonds at every place setting, what if we wrap up a few aspirin?
SOOKIE: Aspirin?
LORELAI: For the morning after hangovers.
SOOKIE: That's funny.
LORELAI: Cause Jordan Almonds are so done. Huh, Jackson what do you think aspirin over almonds?
[Jackson moans.]
LORELAI: Can we take that as a yes?
SOOKIE: No. See, everything eventually registers. He'll chime in on this in a couple of days.
RORY: Days?
SOOKIE: Days.
LORELAI: Hey, is Jackson in the house? Let me here you say unh.
JACKSON: Unh.
LORELAI: A new toy.
RORY: Shameless.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is studying at the kitchen table as Rory walks out of her bedroom]
RORY: How's it going?
LORELAI: I hate these books, hate them.
RORY: Now now.
LORELAI: Agh! See that? They're trying to escape they hate me, too.
RORY: Your books don't hate you.
LORELAI: Ugh, Rory, my brain is full. It has reached capacity. It's Shea Stadium when the Beatles played. It's cramped and girls are screaming and I think
George is fighting with Ringo.
RORY: You have a very active head.
LORELAI: I simply cannot ingest anymore information.
RORY: So take a break.
LORELAI: I don't have time.
RORY: Close your eyes, clear your head.
LORELAI: No, because clearing my head just means that all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out. In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff. It's a very vicious circle.
RORY: I'll make some coffee.
LORELAI: I hate finals.
RORY: Nobody likes finals.
LORELAI: Thank God I'm graduating and this is the last time I have to cram like this because my pursuit of higher education has led me to a very interesting discovery about myself. Do you wanna hear it?
RORY: Sure.
LORELAI: I despise academics. Yup, learning, knowledge, it's all worthless. I have no idea in what you see in any of it.
RORY: Learning is fun, plus for me there's that whole "I'm a minor so it's mandatory" thing.
LORELAI: That's what kills me this is self-inflicted. I'm a masochist. I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it.
RORY: That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile, trust me.
LORELAI: I guess, unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people.
RORY: Hey, you're graduating.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: No, you're graduating there is gonna be a ceremony.
LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. It's community college.
RORY: Well, community colleges have ceremonies.
LORELAI: My community college doesn't even have a lawn, they won't necessarily have a ceremony
RORY: They must. Did you ask?
LORELAI: No. Well, now that you mention it, I think someone said something about some cheesy ceremony for my business class.
RORY: When is it?
LORELAI: I don't know. . .next Thursday or something.
RORY: That's great, you have to do it.
LORELAI: I don't know.
RORY: You have to do it.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Yes. You've never been apart of an actual graduation ceremony.
LORELAI: I know. That's because my stupid conservative high school wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.
RORY: Don't be gross.
LORELAI: Do you really think I should do it?
RORY: Yes! You've worked hard for this, you've earned it.
LORELAI: I guess.
RORY: Come on, you know that deep down you really want to do this.
LORELAI: Well, I'll admit, I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.
RORY: And the hat?
LORELAI: For the tassel cause you know my thing for fringe.
RORY: And they call out your name and people clap and you get your diploma.
LORELAI: Oh, and then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other very symbolic, very dramatic.
RORY: That's it, you're doing it.
LORELAI: All right, if you insist.
RORY: Okay, who do you wanna invite?
LORELAI: I don't know, you.
RORY: And?
LORELAI: That's cool with me.
RORY: Sookie and Jackson?
LORELAI: Aw, that'll be fun.
RORY: Okay. And Grandma and Grandpa?
LORELAI: Oh, no. No no no.
RORY: Come on, it's your graduation. They should be there.
LORELAI: Forget it.
RORY: But --
LORELAI: They won't want to be there.
RORY: Of course they will.
LORELAI: Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school. Go to Vassar. Marry a Yale man and get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny or Shih Tzu.
RORY: Yes but --
LORELAI: Instead, I got pregnant. I didn't finish high school, I didn't marry your father and I ended up in a career that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her.
RORY: That's not - .
LORELAI: I humiliated them. The two proudest people in the world and I humiliated them. I spoiled their plans. I took their fine upbringing in a world of comfort and opportunity and I threw it in their faces. I broke their hearts and they'll never forgive me. I guess I can't expect them to.
RORY: Maybe you're wrong about how they feel about all this. It was a long time ago.
LORELAI: Rory, I don't want them to go. It'll just hurt them. . .and me, okay?
RORY: Okay. You should get back to your studying.
LORELAI: Fine. Oh, great.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I think I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.
RORY: No, you haven't.
LORELAI: Yes, I have. In fact, I may have forgotten everything that I've ever known. Child, what be your name?
RORY: Study.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai, Rory, and Dean are walking through the center of town]
LORELAI: Just explain the concept one more time.
DEAN: And be mocked again? No, thank you.
RORY: Come on.
LORELAI: Yeah, maybe we're missing something.
DEAN: Okay, you go to a special sh**ting range
RORY: A skeet sh**ting range.
DEAN: Right. There's two of you and the guy with the g*n yells "Pull!" and then the other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air and so you try to shoot it.
LORELAI: No, I don't think we're missing anything.
DEAN: Yeah, I knew it.
RORY: You shoot pigeons?
DEAN: Clay pigeons.
LORELAI: When you hit them, does blood come out?
DEAN: They're clay.
RORY: And why do you like to do this?
DEAN: I don't know. My dad shot skeet when he was my age and so he wants to pass the tradition down.
LORELAI: What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?
RORY: Yeah, does that count?
DEAN: That's never happened.
LORELAI: What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon, does that count?
RORY: Yeah, does that count?
DEAN: I've only done this once.
LORELAI: Hey, if you get really good, do you move on to other animals like clay chickens and clay sheep?
DEAN: You know, we didn't go skeet sh**ting, I just made it all up.
LORELAI: [stops in front of the market] Oh, hey, I gotta go in here.
RORY: Oh, what do you need?
LORELAI: Just general stuff. You guys go and be in love.
RORY: I'll see you back at the house.
DEAN: Bye.
RORY: What if you shoot the person who throws the pigeon up in the air? Would that count?
CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET
[Lorelai is shopping and runs into Luke.]
LUKE: Oh.
LORELAI: Dah.
LUKE: Sorry.
LORELAI: No, no, I should have signaled or honked or something, my fault.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: Well, um, I guess it was inevitable us running into each other. It's a very tiny community.
LUKE: Guess so.
LORELAI: How's the diner?
LUKE: It's still there.
LORELAI: Yes, I knew that. I'm able to empirically with my eyes, uh. . .Hey Luke, do you think we could
LUKE: I gotta get back.
LORELAI: Okay, right, right.
CUT TO INSIDE THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[The doorbell rings]
EMILY: I'll get it.
[Emily opens the door]
RORY: Hi Grandma.
EMILY: Hello Rory.
RORY: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
EMILY: I'm thrilled to see you on no notice. So, tell me, what's this about? You were so mysterious on the phone.
RORY: I just wanted to talk to you about something in person.
EMILY: Well, come in, come in.
[Emily leads Rory to a lavishly set table.]
RORY: Wow.
EMILY: It's an English tea service. One the advantages of our having an English maid. That, and the fact that she speaks English.
RORY: You didn't have to do this.
EMILY: But it's tea time and I wanted to. . .oh no! Beatrice, I told you to doily line the plates!
RORY: You don't have to doily line the plates.
RICHARD: [calls from another room] Hello?
EMILY: We're in the dining room.
RICHARD: Oh, oh, Rory, you're already here.
RORY: You're out of breath.
RICHARD: I ran over from the office.
RORY: Oh, you didn't have to run.
RICHARD: Well, your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us. That certainly justifies a run.
EMILY: All right, everybody, sit, sit. Pour the tea, Beatrice.
RORY: Um, actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on pouring the tea for just a minute? Thank you very much. Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you. Now, you can go for it or not, it's entirely up to you, but I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.
EMILY: We won't get upset.
RORY: And that you will try to keep an open mind.
EMILY: All right.
RORY: And that you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.
EMILY: [to Richard] She's been hanging around you far too much.
RICHARD: Rory, we accept your terms. Please proceed.
RORY: Thank you. First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know that I'm here. She'd probably be pretty mad if she knew that I was, but I feel that this is important. As you know, Mom's been going to business school at the community college out here for three years now.
EMILY: I believe she's mentioned it.
RORY: Well, she's doing very well and she's finishing up. Actually, she's graduating Thursday, and there's going to be a ceremony and I think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there. It may not seem like it would, but it's true.
EMILY: Well, if it would mean so much to her then why didn't she invite us herself?
RORY: Because she didn't think you'd wanna go. And I get that, but I think it's a mistake. I had a school thing once, and I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go so I didn't invite her. It was my kindergarten "Salute to Vegetables" pageant and I was broccoli and I did a tap dance with a guy that was playing beets and the entire number I was just thinking, "Mom's not here" and it was my fault that she wasn't there and, well, it was kind of a life lesson for me. Now, if the thought of going to Mom's graduation upsets you or makes you unhappy or uncomfortable in any way, then, please, don't go because this is an important night for Mom and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances. [pulls an envelope out of her backpack] Those are the tickets. It's Thursday, 7pm. It's indoors so weather's not an issue. You can use them or not, no hard feelings, do what you feel is best. And if you don't mind, I would really appreciate it if you would keep this conversation between the three of us. That's all I have to say, thanks very much for your patience. Now, I believe I have time for a scone before my bus leaves.
EMILY: Beatrice, the tea, please.
RORY: Emily, these look delicious. So, Richard, how was your day today?
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is sitting on the coffee table with a drink as Rory reads on the sofa]
LORELAI: I am feeling so good, sista, because it's over! No more finals, no more studying, no more school, the pressure's off. Do you know how much pressure I felt, do you? All last week I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest.
RORY: A giant man?
LORELAI: And his giant brother.
RORY: Did they have names?
LORELAI: Clem and Clem. Huh, same names, which did not reflect well on the imagination of their mothers.
RORY: Mother.
LORELAI: Mothers. There were two Clems.
RORY: Yeah, cause they were brothers.
LORELAI: Yes, so they had mothers.
RORY: Okay, you're drawing me into your drunken world.
LORELAI: It's not a bad place to be, my friend. Mnh-mnh, tank's empty. [walks into the kitchen to get another drink]
RORY: Hey, what is this?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: This, uh, Life Plan' book thing.
LORELAI: A little gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College. Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?
RORY: Um, if you can't remember where the living room is.
LORELAI: Ha ha, I'm still good. [walks back into living room]
RORY: Okay, here's an interesting question for you "Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?"
LORELAI: Oh, well, uh, they're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure. I mean, I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock 'em out and, uh, have Nanny catch 'em and care for 'em, make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come anywhere near them and then just return them to me when they're twenty-one.
RORY: Well, what about me?
LORELAI: You are my favorite eldest child, you get to stay by my side.
RORY: Oh, I feel so privileged.
[Phone rings]
RORY: I'll get it.
LORELAI: Hey, now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up and blow that whistle I gave you.
RORY: [answers phone] Hello?
JESS: Hi. [pause] Hello?
RORY: Hi.
JESS: Is this a bad time?
RORY: Um, no, just hold on a sec? [to Lorelai] Um, the music. . . uh, I'll be right back. [Rory takes the phone to her room and closes the door.] Hi.
JESS: You said that already.
RORY: I did. You're right, sorry.
JESS: So, what's up?
RORY: Nothing. What about you?
JESS: Same.
RORY: So, what have you been doing?
JESS: Nothin' much. Just hanging out. . . in the park, mostly.
RORY: Central Park?
JESS: Washington Square Park.
RORY: Oh.
JESS: It's cooler.
RORY: Yes.
JESS: It's where David Lee Roth got busted.
RORY: Right, right. I hope he's got it together now.
JESS: Sounds like you got a party going on there.
RORY: No, it's just me and my mom.
JESS: Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna go. This is long distance.
RORY: Yeah, it is long distance.
JESS: So, see ya.
RORY: Yeah, see ya.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[On Thursday morning, Rory is getting ready for school in the living room as Lorelai runs around upstairs.]
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: Ahh!
RORY: What's wrong?
LORELAI: I'm experiencing frustration.
RORY: At the general state of things in the world or at something particular?
LORELAI: What do you wear to a graduation?
RORY: Cap and gown.
LORELAI: Duh, I mean underneath.
RORY: Whatever you want. The gown will cover it.
LORELAI: It's more complicated than that. I don't want to overdress so that I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium but if I don't have enough on and it's cold, then I'll freeze.
RORY: It is complicated, especially if you overthink it.
LORELAI: And now I need a helpful comment.
RORY: Take light layers. Wear your turquoise and tan dress that you just got that's cool and it'll look good without your gown on, and wear your turquoise vintagey sweater over it because it'll look great with the dress and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.
LORELAI: You are a fashion genius.
RORY: Well, you've taught me everything I know.
LORELAI: My brain's not working today.
RORY: You're excited, it's a big day.
LORELAI: What time are you getting there?
RORY: I have a bunch of newspaper stuff after school, but no later than six.
LORELAI: And then we'll go out to eat after?
RORY: Any place you want, and it's on me.
LORELAI: You don't have to do that.
RORY: You're the graduate. You get to be pampered.
LORELAI: Okay, then I would like to go to Chateau Jean Georges la Jean Georges in Paris.
RORY: I'll look it up in Zagats and book the Concorde. I gotta go.
LORELAI: Okay, I gotta get ready.
RORY: Wait, wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event.
LORELAI: What do you think do I look ready to make my way in the world?
RORY: Yes, and if all else fails, you can marry rich.
LORELAI: I love that we always have that option.
RORY: Hey, what are you gonna do with your hair?
LORELAI: I got the curling iron warming up.
RORY: Mom, the cap! You put it on, its gonna --
BOTH: - smush the curls down.
LORELAI: You are a genius.
RORY: See you tonight
LORELAI: Hey, try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or Screech or someone.
RORY: I'll try.
CUT TO FRONT OF CHILTON
[Rory is walking with Paris]
PARIS: So I told her, "Look missy--"
RORY: You called your advisor "Missy"?
PARIS: It was attitudinal. I said I'm not taking AP calculus from Henemen. I'm going with Branch. Branch is a graduate of MIT and Henemen went to Berkley. Berkley! I mean, he may have majored in math but what did he minor in? Bean sprouts? Forget it. And I'm telling my advisor all this, Mrs. Schlosser, and I looked down in her trash can and there's this half-eaten banana in there. Nothing else. And I pictured her sitting in the shoe box of an office eating a banana all by herself and I almost felt sorry for her, but then she questioned my judgment about Berkley so I eviscerated her. I mean, she was welling up at the end, but she had the decency to hold it in until I was gone. I have enough faculty recommendations to run for student council, so I don't need her anyway. My locker's this way.
[As Paris walks toward the building, Rory turns and goes back out the gates.]
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Sookie carries a cake into the room as Lorelai sits at the counter with her eyes closed]
SOOKIE: Are they closed?
LORELAI: They're closed.
SOOKIE: Are you sure?
LORELAI: I'm sure.
SOOKIE: Okay, one second and open, open, open.
LORELAI: Aw, you made me a tassel hat cake!
SOOKIE: Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans.
LORELAI: You're evil.
SOOKIE: And you're graduating.
LORELAI: Yes I am, aren't I?
SOOKIE: Here. Oh, hey, I brought those pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation.
LORELAI: Hand them over, lady.
SOOKIE: Okay, but don't laugh.
LORELAI: I promise.
SOOKIE: I was younger then, not as refined.
LORELAI: Ha, and you're stoned.
SOOKIE: Totally.
LORELAI: I thought you hated that.
SOOKIE: It was peer pressure. At my school, if Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off.
LORELAI: Well, I think Gilbert had a snappy slogan.
SOOKIE: Oh, I was nauseous all day.
LORELAI: Your parents?
SOOKIE: For the traditional parents-flanking-their-graduate shot. Don't they look proud?
LORELAI: They do, very proud.
[Michel walks into the kitchen]
MICHEL: What is that?
LORELAI: Oh, it's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation. What was your high school graduation like, Michel?
MICHEL: It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are. Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed.
LORELAI: You drank some Boone's Farm out of a boda bag and knocked a beach ball around?
MICHEL: I don't understand half of what you said.
LORELAI: That's why we work.
[Cell phone rings.]
LORELAI: [answers] Hello?
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, Lor, how you doing?
LORELAI: Christopher. I'm good, I'm excited.
CHRISTOPHER: You should be, it's a big day. Did you get my present?
LORELAI: What present?
CHRISTOPHER: A basket. You should've gotten it by now.
LORELAI: Hey, did a basket come for me?
MICHEL: Mm, it came, it was heavy, I felt a twinge so I dropped it for health reasons. It's probably still intact.
LORELAI: My crack staff has just informed me of its arrival. I'm going to find it. [walks into the lobby and sees the basket on a table] Wow!
CHRISTOPHER: I put it together myself.
LORELAI: And it's all for me?
CHRISTOPHER: All for you.
LORELAI: Chris. . wow. [starts looking through the basket] Ha! A twenty-five dollar savings bond.
CHRISTOPHER: That's a long-term investment. Don't touch it for thirty years, you're looking at forty-five dollars.
LORELAI: Ooh, a youth hostel card.
CHRISTOPHER: For the young girl who doesn't mind sharing a bathroom with fifty strangers.
LORELAI: "What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job Hunters."
CHRISTOPHER: Helping you answer the two questions: what do you want to do and where do you want to do it?
LORELAI: A DVD of The Graduate, gotta have that. Ooh, The Portable Nietzsche.
CHRISTOPHER: Light, cheery reading.
LORELAI: An application to join the Armed Forces.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, if your dreams don't pan out and Nietzsche's no help, it's a viable option.
LORELAI: And something in a nice little velvet box. Ooh, a necklace, and the pearl almost looks real.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, it better look very real, because it is.
LORELAI: That's not funny.
CHRISTOPHER: This is not a funny gift.
LORELAI: Christopher, this is extremely not funny. This is totally humorless. It's. . .it's beautiful.
CHRISTOPHER: I think you're awesome, Lor. With everything you do and raising Rory the way you did, you're superwoman.
LORELAI: Wow.
CHRISTOPHER: Have a great day. I wish I could be there. Take lots of pictures for me.
LORELAI: Ugh, the camera, I forgot the camera.
CHRISTOPHER: Look in the basket.
LORELAI: [pulls out a disposable camera] Oh, you thought of everything.
CHRISTOPHER: Have a great night.
LORELAI: Thanks, you too. Bye.
CUT TO BUS STATION
[Rory gets off the bus and looks around. She walks out of the station and onto the crowded sidewalk.]
RORY: Could you. . .um, excuse me, sir, do you know. . . do you know where Washington. . .excuse me, ma'am. . .Washington Square Park?
WOMAN: End of Fifth.
RORY: Thank you! [to someone else] Excuse me, where's Fifth?
CUT TO WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK
[Jess is reading on a bench as Rory walks up behind him]
RORY: Hi.
JESS: How ya doing?
RORY: Good, how about you?
JESS: Good. You hungry?
RORY: Starved.
JESS: I know a place.
[They walk off together.]
CUT TO NEW YORK STREET
[Jess and Rory are walking down the street]
RORY: I feel very urban today.
JESS: Oh yeah, the plaid just screams urban.
RORY: I think I look like a native.
JESS: How well do you know Manhattan?
RORY: I've been here a few times. We saw The Bangles here.
JESS: When was that, twenty years ago?
RORY: It was a reunion and they were great.
JESS: Yeah, they're okay.
RORY: And a couple years ago Mom drove us in to shop, and she couldn't find a good parking place and all of the parking lots were a total rip-off, so she kept making U-turns and cutting off taxis and we were being screamed at in so many different languages that we just turned around and drove home and bought a Hummel at the curio store in Stars Hollow.
JESS: How very adventurous.
RORY: I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple.
JESS: You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.
RORY: So I don't have the lingo down yet, but at least I have the attitude.
JESS: You do, huh?
RORY: Oh yeah. When I was getting a locker for my backpack at the bus stop, there was this guy and he was just standing there staring at me and instead of ignoring him I just fixed him with a really withering stare.
JESS: That I've got to see.
RORY: No.
JESS: Oh, come on, let me see your withering stare.
RORY: It's dangerous. I could hurt you.
JESS: I've been hurt before.
RORY: No.
JESS: I'm disappointed. So your arm's okay?
RORY: Yeah, it looks worse than it is.
JESS: [Looks at Rory's cast.] I like this Emily chick. Friend of yours?
RORY: She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.
JESS: So here's our lunch place.
RORY: A hot dog stand?
JESS: Hey, I eat here everyday. It's nothing fancy, but -
RORY: No, I love it. It's perfect.
JESS: Good. [to hot dog vendor] One with everything on it.
RORY: Make that two, please.
JESS: So, uh. . .how's -
RORY: Luke?
JESS: Yeah.
RORY: Okay. He went fishing.
JESS: Fishing?
RORY: Yeah. He didn't catch anything though.
JESS: Probably used the wrong bait.
RORY: Yeah, that's a common fishing blunder.
JESS: So he's good?
RORY: Yeah, he's good. I can tell him hello for you if you want.
JESS: Whatever.
RORY: [to hot dog vendor] Thank you. [takes a bite] Oh, my God, this is really good!
JESS: I'm glad you like it. So how much time you got?
RORY: I got a bit.
JESS: There's a record store you should check out. It's run by this insane freak who's like a walking encyclopedia for every punk and garage-band record ever made. Catalog numbers. . .it's crazy. The place is right out of High Fidelity.
RORY: Let's go.
JESS: Okay.
RORY: Where you going?
JESS: Subway.
RORY: I thought we were gonna walk.
JESS: It's fifteen blocks. Come on, I think you'll like it.
RORY: Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?
JESS: You are so an out-of-towner.
CUT TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE
[Lorelai walks into the auditorium, then follows a sign to the graduate check-in room.]
LORELAI: Excuse me, hi, I'm one of the graduates.
MAN: Wow, you're hours early.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, I just wanted to beat traffic and have time to get ready and relax, and also, I've heard the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains in them.
MAN: This is true. Take your pick.
LORELAI: Thank you. This is so exciting. Isn't this exciting?
MAN: This is my eighth year of doing this.
LORELAI: So, not so exciting for you, got it.
[As Lorelai looks through a rack of gowns, Emily walks by the open door. Lorelai catches a glimpse of her]
LORELAI: Huh.
[Lorelai thinks for a moment, then goes into the auditorium to see if it was really Emily]
EMILY: [to cameraman] You're being so cryptic. Do you need a power source or not?
RAUL: Look, my batteries are all fully charged. It just depends on how fast they deplete.
EMILY: So, we need one just in case?
LORELAI: Mom.
EMILY: Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony. What are you doing here?
LORELAI: Um, I'm just getting. . .I'm sorry, what are you doing here? How do you even know about this?
EMILY: I shouldn't know about this? A mother can't know about this?
LORELAI: No, I just mean -
EMILY: You're graduating.
LORELAI: I know.
EMILY: So, we're here to see you graduate. This is Raul.
LORELAI: Hey. So, you and Raul are just here to see me graduate?
EMILY: Don't be silly. Your father will be joining me later.
LORELAI: My father?
EMILY: Yes, remember him? Tall, bow tie.
LORELAI: I remember Dad, Mom. I just. . .ah, Rory told you.
EMILY: Yes. That's okay, isn't it? It's a little late if it's not.
LORELAI: Oh, no, it's perfectly fine that you're here, absolutely. I'm just surprised. [to Raul] Who are you?
RAUL: I'm Raul.
EMILY: I just told you that.
LORELAI: Yes, well, did Rory invite Raul, too?
EMILY: Raul is my cameraman.
LORELAI: Cameraman?
EMILY: He's going to be filming the ceremony for us. He's very talented. He screened an independent film of his as an audition, "Welcome to Scab Land."
It was disgusting, but beautifully photographed.
RAUL: It was supposed to be disgusting.
LORELAI: I'm sure it was. Mom, all this stuff. . .
MAN: Excuse me, all of this equipment, it can't be here.
EMILY: Well, obviously we're not going to leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over. We're not cretins.
LORELAI: She's handling it. Right, Mom? You're handling it.
RAUL: Okay, this lighting sucks!
EMILY: Can we do something about the lighting?
MAN: I don't think so, ma'am. I don't know.
EMILY: [to Raul] It's a community college, we'll just have to cope. Think documentary.
LORELAI: Mom, please. People will be showing up here soon. You can't --
EMILY: Lorelai, I am perfectly capable of handling this. No one will be inconvenienced.
LORELAI: Okay, I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all this because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee and maybe hammer a nail into my head.
EMILY: You're not needed here, Lorelai. Go get your coffee, relax. You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?
LORELAI: Maybe an Irish coffee.
CUT TO NEW YORK RECORD STORE
[Rory and Jess are looking through the records]
JESS: I haven't even heard of half these bands.
RORY: I love that about this place. God, Lane would wanna live here.
JESS: Who's Slim?
RORY: I don't know.
OWNER: Grunge band out of Kentucky. Two albums, plus a double-A side single, disbanded in '94.
JESS: Thanks.
RORY: [looks through the records] Oh my God!
JESS: What?
RORY: Look! [shows him a record]
JESS: Go-go's. You must have that one.
RORY: No, for my mom. This was her favorite group when she was my age, and it's signed by Belinda. This would be the perfect graduation present. I've been looking for something all week long, and I couldn't find anything and now I have Belinda.
JESS: Graduation?
RORY: Oh, from college, from business classes.
JESS: I'm surprised she has time for anything except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.
RORY: Well, it's not a lot of time, but . . .
JESS: Uh-huh. Go on, get it. She'll like it.
RORY: Thank you so much for bringing me here. This was fate.
JESS: Yes, it was.
RORY: And in return, I just might show you my withering stare.
JESS: I'm a lucky man.
CUT TO BUS STATION
[Rory and Jess are walking toward her bus]
RORY: I think this one's mine.
JESS: Yup, the sign says Boonesville.
TOURIST: Excuse me, I'm so sorry to bother you. Which way is 44th?
RORY: Oh, um, that way.
TOURIST: Great, thanks.
RORY: I got asked directions.
JESS: I saw.
RORY: He took me for a native. That's so cool.
JESS: That's very impressive. 44th's the other way.
RORY: Oh no.
JESS: Sorry.
RORY: Oh, man, I should go find him.
JESS: He'll figure it out when he sees all the numbers getting smaller instead of bigger.
RORY: He still thought I was a native. That's cool.
JESS: I'm your witness.
RORY: Well, I should go.
JESS: Okay.
RORY: I gotta go to my mom's graduation.
JESS: And give her Belinda.
RORY: And give her Belinda.
JESS: Go on. I'll check on the guy, I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44.
[Rory boards the bus and looks at Jess through the window.]
JESS: Why did you come here?
[Rory opens the window.]
RORY: What?
JESS: I said, why did you come here?
RORY: Well -
JESS: I mean, you ditched school and everything. That's so not you. Why'd you do it?
RORY: Because you didn't say goodbye.
JESS: Oh. Bye, Rory.
RORY: Bye, Jess.
CUT TO GRADUATE CHECK-IN ROOM
[Lorelai is fixing her makeup near the chalkboard. She sneezes and stirs up a cloud of chalk dust.]
LORELAI: Great, I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.
LIZA: You thought ahead. Smart.
LORELAI: Oh, the mirror? Yeah, I never leave home without all the essentials: mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy. I'm done. Do you want to use it?
LIZA: Thanks. Oh, don't I look charming?
LORELAI: Oh, you look great.
LIZA: I've looked better. I had to run here straight from work -- Kinko's.
ZACH: Hey, Liza, that gets me thinking maybe you and I oughta do a little reproducing after the ceremony.
LIZA: Clever.
ZACH: Don't be a snot.
LIZA: Shut up! [to Lorelai] That's my boyfriend, Zach.
LORELAI: Oh, sure.
LIZA: Of course, we're breaking up 'cause we're transferring to different schools. He's going to Florida State, I'm going to UMass. . .although I'm kinda going to miss this place.
ZACH: I'm not. This place stunk. It's Bush League.
LORELAI: Why'd you go here?
ZACH: My parents, wise investors that they are, couldn't afford anything else.
LIZA: Yeah, I guess that two-point-zilch grade point average didn't reason into things.
ZACH: Shut up.
LIZA: Between the lines.
ZACH: Go die.
LORELAI: Are you sure you two don't wanna give it another go, 'cause you're darling together.
LIZA: Thanks for the mirror.
LORELAI: My pleasure.
LIZA: Hey, a bunch of us are going to Shakey's afterwards for a pizza. You wanna come?
LORELAI: Aw, I'm going out with my daughter after, but it sounds like fun.
ZACH: Okay, you guys are not going to believe this. There's some blue-blooded rich woman out there setting up professional film equipment like she's sh**ting a movie or something.
LORELAI: You're kidding.
LIZA: Whose mother is it?
ZACH: I don't know. Little Precious must be around here somewhere though.
LIZA: I hate people with money.
ZACH: So do I, with every fiber of my being.
LORELAI: Me too. Money people, ugh.
CUT TO BUS
[Rory's bus is still at the station. She walks up to the bus driver.]
RORY: Excuse me?
DRIVER: Yes?
RORY: Are we leaving soon?
DRIVER: I have no idea.
RORY: Well, should you have an idea?
DRIVER: There was an accident, closed the interstate. All outbound buses were told to stand down.
RORY: Oh. And you don't know when we're going to be allowed to stand up again?
DRIVER: Soon, I hope. I hate missing dinner.
RORY: Yeah. . .me, too.
CUT TO GRADUATE CHECK-IN ROOM
[Sookie and Jackson walk over to Lorelai]
SOOKIE: There's our little graduate. Oh, my God, look at that gown. You look just like the Statue of Liberty.
LORELAI: Ah, all big and stony?
SOOKIE: No, you look amazing.
LORELAI: Hmm. You look very G.Q.
JACKSON: Oh, thanks to my best new friend Ermenegildo Zegna.
SOOKIE: Don't you love how he can pronounce it and all?
LORELAI: Very Cosmopolitan.
SOOKIE: He got it for the rehearsal dinner. It's his first real suit.
JACKSON: And not my last. I look hot!
LORELAI: Mmm.
SOOKIE: So, you know that Emily's out there, right?
LORELAI: Oh, shh!
SOOKIE: Why shh?
LORELAI: It's a long story. Just do me a favor?
SOOKIE: Sure.
LORELAI: Keep an eye on my parents, make sure they don't disrupt anything, my mother doesn't behead anyone, my father doesn't snore too loudly when he falls asleep.
SOOKIE: They're not gonna do anything like that.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, have you not met them?
SOOKIE: Why would they come and do that?
LORELAI: They're here because Rory invited them.
SOOKIE: No.
LORELAI: Yes! They can't say no to that little face. It's like hitting a puppy with a rolled-up newspaper.
ZACH: Hey, you guys are not gonna believe this.
LIZA: You're Mr. Announcement Guy today.
ZACH: What, are you going to pipe in every time I talk?
LIZA: Can it!
ZACH: Stuff it!
LORELAI: They're in love.
SOOKIE: Clearly.
ZACH: So, Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too.
LORELAI: [quietly] Oh, no.
ZACH: It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.
SOOKIE: [quietly] That's Emily, right?
LORELAI: Shh!
LIZA: Rich people feel so entitled.
LORELAI: Yeah, damn them!
ZACH: I swear, I saw her wipe her face with a hundred dollar bill.
LORELAI: We should line them up against a wall, you know what I'm saying?
WOMAN: Is Lorelai Gilmore here?
LORELAI: Yes.
WOMAN: Oh, good. Have a look at these, will you? [shows her a box of corsages]
LORELAI: Wow!
SOOKIE: Pretty.
WOMAN: Look them over and take your pick.
LORELAI: What for?
WOMAN: To wear.
LORELAI: Are they for sale?
WOMAN: No, they're paid for. These are from your mother, Emily Gilmore.
LIZA: Wow, ritzy.
LORELAI: I really don't want to wear a corsage.
WOMAN: They're all paid for.
LORELAI: Really, it's too much.
WOMAN: Your mother wants you to pick one.
LORELAI: Really, it's okay.
WOMAN: She'll just come back here herself.
LORELAI: This one, thanks.
WOMAN: Good choice. The cameraman said that would look best on film.
ZACH: So you're the rich girl.
LORELAI: Maybe. I'm not rich but . . .my parents have money, but I'm totally self-sufficient. I take nothing from them, except this corsage. . .and my daughter's tuition. So, you gonna stone me?
ZACH: I should have guessed. Look at her friends, they're wearing suits that drip money.
JACKSON: Hey pal, this was thirty percent off!
LIZA: So, that's why you didn't want to get pizza, 'cause it's below you?
LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no, Liza, pizza is not below me. Believe me, I love pizza. I eat tons of pizza. It's one of my four major food groups: candy, popcorn, and pizza see? It's two of my food groups, that's how much I love pizza.
LIZA: I want to believe you.
ZACH: Enjoy your champagne and caviar at The Ritz, Your Highness.
LORELAI: I am not rich! Ugh! [Pager beeps] My pager.
JACKSON: Maybe the suit was a little much.
SOOKIE: You're a fox, now don't start.
LORELAI: [reads pager] Oh, no.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: Rory's running late.
SOOKIE: Late from what?
LORELAI: It doesn't say. It says she's definitely going to be here but if she's not here by seven, she'll sneak in the back. That's weird.
SOOKIE: She'll be here, don't worry.
LORELAI: I hope so.
SOOKIE: How 'bout we sit in back, keep an eye out for her, and we'll save her a seat?
LORELAI: That'd be great. Oh, can you hang onto all my stuff for me? I don't want to leave it in here.
SOOKIE: Will do.
LORELAI: Thank you. Bye.
ZACH: Oh, you don't trust your valuables around us poor kids, huh?
LORELAI: Knock it off, Zach!
CUT TO BUS
[Rory's bus makes a stop and some people get off]
SEATMATE: You don't look happy.
RORY: I'm late.
SEATMATE: Buses are the worst.
RORY: Why are we making so many stops? The bus didn't make stops on the way into the city.
SEATMATE: Oh, that was probably an express. This is a local makes a lot of stops.
RORY: I should have checked the schedule. I should have checked traffic. Note to self: impulsive definitely does not work for me. [notices seatmate holding a soda can to his lips] What are you doing?
SEATMATE: Hmm? Oh, uh, it's for my spit.
RORY: Your what?
SEATMATE: From my smokeless.
CUT TO GRADUATION CEREMONY
[A speaker on stage is calling the graduates up]
SPEAKER: Victor David Fuller. . . Nancy Brenda Gatson. . .
[Zach sees Lorelai looking around the room.]
ZACH: Making sure the camera's getting your best side, princess?
RICHARD: [whispers to Emily] Are you telling me that that is the best commencement speaker they could scrounge up?
EMILY: I hope Raul's getting enough shots of Lorelai. I don't want the whole damn ceremony and none of her.
RICHARD: Oh, no, I disagree. I hope he gets every inspired word articulated by the East Coast Marketing Director of Pup n' Taco.
EMILY: Raul!
[As Emily points to the stage, Raul and the sound guy rush down the aisle.]
SPEAKER: Joanne Garver...
[Raul shoves the camera in Lorelai's face.]
LORELAI: Oh, geez. Oh, we're, oh, we're going. . .
SPEAKER: John Lawrence Gilfer. . . Lorelai Victoria Gilmore. . . Gretchen Greeman. . .
[Emily and Richard look on proudly as Lorelai accepts her diploma and moves her tassel to the other side of her cap.]
CUT TO AUDITORIUM
[After the ceremony, Lorelai walks up to Emily and Richard]
LORELAI: Hey, Mom, Dad.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Well, I did it.
RICHARD: Yes.
EMILY: Raul thinks he got some good footage.
RICHARD: I should hope so. He certainly cost enough.
LORELAI: I'm sure it'll be great.
EMILY: Congratulations, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Thank you. I'm glad you guys came.
EMILY: Yes, well, we should get going. I guess we'll see you tomorrow for dinner. [they start to leave]
LORELAI: Hey, wait. Aren't we going to take a picture?
EMILY: Excuse me?
LORELAI: The three of us, me in the middle with the gown, you know the traditional pose.
RICHARD: Well, uh, we don't have a camera with us.
LORELAI: Hold on. [pulls the disposable camera out of her pocket]
EMILY: That's a camera?
LORELAI: That's a camera.
RICHARD: That looks like a toy.
LORELAI: Um, Raul, would you mind? [they pose together] So. . .
RAUL: Okay, on the count of one, two, three, cheese! [takes picture]
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: Yes, well, tomorrow then.
LORELAI: Absolutely.
EMILY: Let's go, Richard.
RICHARD: I'll be right there, Emily. [hands Lorelai an envelope] Congratulations.
LORELAI: Oh, you don't have to do this.
RICHARD: Put it towards something fun.
LORELAI: Thank you, Daddy.
[Emily and Richard leave as Sookie and Jackson walk over]
SOOKIE: Hey, we're so proud of you!
JACKSON: Yeah, you were great up there.
LORELAI: Thanks, you guys. Where's Rory? No Rory?
SOOKIE: She called your cell and I answered and she said she got hung up on something or other and she'll see you at home.
LORELAI: Hung up? Hung up where? Is she okay?
SOOKIE: She said she's fine. She's sorry, but fine.
LORELAI: Oh. Well, as long as she's okay, I guess. Um, well, I should probably get the gown back. Thanks for coming, Sook, Marcus Schenkenberg.
SOOKIE: You wanna go out to eat? Celebrate a little?
LORELAI: No, I think I'll just go home to Rory.
SOOKIE: I thought so. See you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Thanks.
JACKSON: Wait a minute. . .aspirins instead of Jordan Almonds? But we already bought the almonds.
SOOKIE: Wow. Now that's the longest anything's ever taken.
JACKSON: My family's not gonna get the joke. Can't we just use the almonds?
SOOKIE: Okay, sweetie, calm down.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory is waiting out front as Lorelai pulls into the driveway.]
RORY: I'm so, so sorry.
LORELAI: You're okay, right?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Everything's working? Your wrist is okay, nothing new is broken?
RORY: I'm fine.
LORELAI: Anyone you know, like Lane or someone, suddenly get sick today or break an arm themselves or get in a car wreck?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Okay, good. Then I can get past worry and move onto other things.
RORY: I know you're hurt.
LORELAI: Yeah, you bet I'm hurt. Rory, I really wanted you there today, more than anything. You're why I did this stupid thing in the first place.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: It was a once in a lifetime thing. You should've been there. My best friend should've been there. Whatever it was that kept you, you should've gotten out of it, at least this once. Was it school?
RORY: It wasn't school.
LORELAI: Was it Paris?
RORY: It wasn't Paris.
LORELAI: Well, what was it?
RORY: It was so stupid.
LORELAI: Well, Rory, where were you? What happened?
RORY: I cut school!
LORELAI: You what?
RORY: I cut school and I got on a bus and I don't even know why I did it. I. . .I have no excuse. I was just standing outside of Chilton, and I don't know, I must have had a stroke or something. What does a stroke feel like?
LORELAI: I don't know. Not good, probably.
RORY: And I left school and I got on a bus and I went to New York. And that's it! I'm grounded for six months, or seven, and no TV, no stereo, no reading. In fact, take all of my books away from me and lock them up.
LORELAI: Hold on here. You went to New York?
RORY: And no magazines, either. And I'm going to do all of the housework. Laundry, dishes. . . in fact, we're going to start eating at home so that we have dishes.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Stop. Why did you go to New York?
RORY: To see Jess.
LORELAI: Boy, do you know how to bury the lead.
RORY: I don't know what happened.
LORELAI: You went to New York to see Jess.
RORY: It was the stroke! It made me someone else, and after his phone call last night -
LORELAI: That was him?
RORY: It did something to me, I don't know what. In fact, you should take the phone away from me, too. That's right, add it to the list. No books, no music, no phone.
LORELAI: Okay, Rory. . .
RORY: I'm a horrible person.
LORELAI: You're not a horrible person.
RORY: I am sick, I'm ill, I'm cracked. This is not who I am. If I were to write this down in my diary and I would read it, I would be like, Who is this freak? This isn't me. This isn't my diary. I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't skip school when I have finals coming up to go see a guy that isn't even my guy and end up missing my mother's graduation, which I wanted to be at so badly. That's someone else. That's someone flighty and stupid and dumb and girly. And, I mean, I missed your graduation, which is the worst thing I could have possibly done. I mean, I hurt you and I had to spend hours on a stinky bus next to a guy that was spitting into a can, just thinking about all of the minutes that were going by that I wasn't at your graduation and they were hurting you, and they should have been hurting you because it was so selfish of this person who wasn't me to do what she did.
LORELAI: Okay, my God, take a breath.
RORY: I don't deserve a breath. No breaths. You should add that to the list. You should beat me, ground me, take the phone away and deprive me of air.
LORELAI: Okay, look, nobody wants to say this any less than me, but I - maybe you don't have a medical condition or a mental problem. Maybe, honey, you are falling for Jess.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Well -
RORY: No, I love Dean. Dean is my boyfriend. He will always be my boyfriend. That's it. Forever.
LORELAI: Well, maybe not forever.
RORY: Yes, forever. I love Dean and Jess is gone now and everything's going to be good again. Everything's going to be all right.
LORELAI: Rory, you cut school.
RORY: Yeah, I know.
LORELAI: You got on a bus and went to a strange city in your uniform to see Jess.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: Well, that doesn't mean nothing. That means something. I mean--
RORY: No! I don't want to talk about this anymore. The only thing I want to talk about is the list I made on the bus of all the ways I'm gonna make this up to you. You get total control over the remote and the stereo for as long as you want. Total control over takeout food choices and a special surprise present every day for a month and -- oh my God! I left your present on the bus.
LORELAI: What present?
RORY: It was a vinyl copy of The Go-Gos original album and it was signed by Belinda, but it's not the only copy and I'm gonna find another copy. That's going on the list, too.
LORELAI: Okay, honey, please. Forget about the list until tomorrow.
RORY: Okay, I'll just go to bed then and...I'll go to my room.
LORELAI: Hold on one second. Does this mean I have to eat alone?
RORY: Well, it's up to you. Sending me to bed without supper, you can't lose with that punishment. It's a classic.
LORELAI: I'd rather go out with my daughter tonight.
RORY: I don't deserve it.
LORELAI: No, but I do.
RORY: Okay, just let me take a shower and get the horrible smell of this horrible day off of me, and then we'll go anywhere you want, my treat, and I won't enjoy it. And then we'll come home and I'll go straight to bed and I'll have a terrible night's sleep, okay?
LORELAI: Sounds great.
RORY: I'm so, so sorry, Mom.
LORELAI: Oh, really? 'Cause you didn't make that clear.
RORY: I won't be long.
