lorelai youre sisters moving here
they start picking up the spilled food in the hallway and bringing it inside
luke nope
lorelai well, im sorry, i dont get it
luke theres nothing to get its just liz shes too busy, she cant handle him, shes sending him here
lorelai wheres his dad
luke oh well, the great prize that my sister picked up at a der wienerschnitzel left her about two years ago, whereabouts unknown
lorelai aww, geez
luke yup
lorelai so shes just sending him here, just like that
luke oh no, im sure she put at least five or six minutes of thought into it
lorelai but why
luke well, cause apparently hes been getting into some trouble and liz is afraid hes heading for something bad, and rather than handle it herself, shes just giving up shes sending him here so i can straighten him out
lorelai you
luke yes
lorelai you can straighten him out
luke yes
lorelai you, luke danes, the great communicator, youre going to straighten the kid out
luke all he needs is a change of pace, a new crowd, and to get away from the nutjob that, unfortunately, is my sister
lorelai well, how long is he staying
luke i dont know indefinitely
lorelai and how old is he
luke seventeen
lorelai oh, wow that is very generous of you
luke well, its family, what else can you do
lorelai right so what kind of trouble has he gotten into
luke ah, just kid stuff, you know, staying out late, getting rowdy i dont know exactly
lorelai well, you might want to find out ask a couple of subtle questions, you know, has he seen the shawshank redemption, did the setting seem homey to him stuff like that
luke look, his problem is obvious, its his mother you never could count on liz for anything our mom died when we were kids, right it was just my dad, me and liz and my dad worked all the time and i worked in the store with my dad, and liz was off doing god knows what
lorelai well, i bet losing her mom so early was kind of hard on her
luke it was hard on all of us, but we did our part and then the minute she graduates high school, she is outta here didnt matter that my dad was sick, didnt matter that the store was failing, she just took off married the hot dog king, had a kid, he left, now here we are luke starts pumping up an air mattress
lorelai yeah, wow, thatsim sorry, what are you doing
luke im blowing this up
lorelai what is it
luke its a bed
lorelai a bed
luke for jess
lorelai jess
luke jess, my nephew
lorelai luke, um, thats not a bed, thats a raft, which is fine if youre gonna build a moat around the diner but
luke its fine
lorelai luke, the kid needs a bed if you want to get him something inflatable, make it a blonde
luke im getting him a bed, this is just temporary
lorelai hey, how does jess feel about this
luke i dont know
lorelai you havent talked to him about it
luke no
lorelai dont you think you should
luke why he doesnt have a choice his moms a flake, hes coming here, end of story
lorelai are you sure youre ready for this
luke of course im sure
lorelai i mean, taking on a full time kid, thats a lot of work
luke i know
lorelai and a seventeenyearold thats been getting into trouble and now is being shipped off without his consent, that could be even harder
luke look, all he needs is to be around someone whos not a selfish basketcase, who will give him a little space, who will treat him like a man
lorelai maybe you should think about this
luke theres nothing to think about hes family you take care of family, period
lorelai yes, i respect that, but what if he turns out to be fredo
luke are you seriously telling me not to do this
lorelai no, im not telling you not to do this

louise wow, you know so much so soon you have a gift
madeline i know hey paris, what do you think about me writing a gossip column for the franklin
paris huh i dont know thats a hard one i mean, this is the franklin, a newspaper thats been around for almost a hundred years there have been at least ten former editors of the franklin that have gone on to work at the new york times six have gone onto the washington post three are contributing editors at the new yorker i think one even went on to win the pullitzer prize but never mind them i could be the first editor in the history of the franklin to introduce a column exclusively devoted to who biffys boffing today quandary you know, im gonna have to get back to you on that one
madeline okay
teacher oh good, were all here and prompt, lovely well, ive read everyones article, and they were all extremely well done snappy, informative, wellresearched paris, you should be very proud of the team youve assembled here this year
paris thank you
teacher i mean, when youve got a reporter who can take an incredibly mundane and seemingly unimportant subject like the repaving of the faculty parking lot and turn it into a bittersweet piece on how everybody and everything eventually becomes obsolete, then youve really got something miss gilmore, i was touched
rory i owe it all to paris
teacher i would strongly advise that next time you give miss gilmore something with a little more meat to it
paris oh, yeah, great idea
teacher okay, lets get down to work here weve got a layout to put together
rory walks to a computer and sits down paris walks over to her
paris well, congratulations
rory thank you
paris you must be very proud of yourself
rory well, im not hiding when i pass a mirror
paris i guess its part of my job as editor to make sure that our best writers are writing our best pieces, so im going to give you one of our best pieces
rory uh huh
paris front page, lead story, above the fold
rory get to the catch paris
paris no catch
rory no catch
paris id like to start out year off with a profile on the teacher voted most popular from the year before you know, an indepth, no holds barred interview everybody wants it you have it
rory youre kidding
paris nope
rory well, thanks
paris youre welcome so go ahead and set up that interview with mr medina as soon as possible
rory what
paris i know its short notice but id love it to lead off the first edition
rory mr medina
paris he was the winner by a landslide
rory but
paris im sorry, is there a problem i mean, is there some reason why you wouldnt want to interview him after all, you of all people should be able to get the most indepth story out of him, especially since he and your mother are involved they are still involved, arent they
rory lets just leave my mothers personal life out of this, okay
paris oh, that sounds bad
rory its not bad, its just none of your business
paris fine you want the interview or not
rory yes, i want the interview
paris good get me something more than his favorite color, okay

cut to chilton
rory walks down the hallway and stops in front of a door she pauses a second before walking inside inside the classroom, max is sitting at a desk
rory hi
max rory, hi
rory am i too early cause i can
max no, no
rory come back some other time
max this is fine
rory tomorrow maybe
max now is good
rory this is weird
max yeah, it is
rory i dont really know how to act
max im not completely sure of that myself we could sit
rory sit, sure, thats good barbara walters sits, or walks sometimes if the person shes talking to has a horse or a ranch or a big backyard sometimes, but usually she just sits okay, so i guess we should just start she sits across from him
max good idea
rory do you mind if i tape this
max oh, no, not at all
rory okay turns on tape recorder so i guess ill just dive in full name
max max arturo medina
rory youre kidding
max no, im not
rory where does that come from
max my fathers butcher was named arturo
rory really
max and when my mother was pregnant with me, she went through this phase where all she would eat was lamb chops so arturo would cut her the extra large lamb chops and only charge her for the regular sized lamb chops, which in my family made you eligible for sainthood
rory hence the arturo
max thats right
rory well, i assume that you are aware that you were overwhelmingly voted the students favorite teacher last year
max i teach an exceptional bunch of young people im glad they seem to like me as much as i like them
rory have you ever thought of doing something other than teaching
max well, my father wanted me to be a doctor, and my mother wanted me to be president, and i wanted to be   a clown
rory what
max when i was a kid, i went to the circus and i saw this man who was dressed in this crazy outfit, and he could juggle and he rode on an elephant and the people loved him and i thought, well, thats it thats for me
rory how long did that last
max junior high and then slowly i figured out that i wanted to teach plus, when you told people that you wanted to be a clown they tended to get very frightened
rory mom took me to the circus once, when i was really little and, um, this clown knocked into me and i dropped my cotton candy, and we didnt have a lot of money back then so she couldnt buy me another one, and i started crying so she literally chased the clown on stage, ripped off his wig and said she wouldnt give it back to him unless he bought me another cotton candy
max which i bet he did
rory it was twice as big as the first one and i threw up all the way home
max yeah, that sounds like your mom
rory do you ever regret the fact that you didnt become a clown
max i dont really believe in regrets all my experiences, even the ones that didnt turn out the way i wanted them to, i firmly believe they were all worth it
rory turns off the tape recorder
rory i just want you to know, i really wanted you to be my stepfather
max i just want you to know, i really wanted to be your stepfather
theyre silent for a few seconds, then rory turns back on tape recorder
rory so, what would you say are the great challenges facing high school graduates today
max well, a myriad of things really
cut to outside stars hollow high
luke is waiting out front as jess walks out
luke hey how was school
jess great
luke you learn anything good
jess oh yeah, tons of things ive got gold stars plastered all over my forehead
luke i had an interesting call today wanna know who it was from
jess not really
luke it was from taylor doose, you know he owns the market
jess if you say so
luke he said you came in today
jess he did
luke and he said you took some money out of a little donation cup to help repair the bridge i told him he was crazy, you wouldnt do that, you werent a thief, that he was just trying to start trouble, then i hung up on him but dont get me wrong, i enjoy hanging up on taylor, and he is crazy, but i was just wondering if maybe any of the other things he said were true
jess what do you think
luke i think that if you tell me that what hes saying is not true, then im gonna believe its not true
jess okay, its not true
luke that doesnt sound very convincing
jess look, what exactly do you want from me you bring me here to this place, you put me in a school that says the pledge of allegiance in six different languages, two of which ive never heard of before you take me away from my home, my friends, and now you want what from me
luke im trying to help you
jess well, stop trying stop talking to me, stop following me, and stop asking me questions just stop
luke thats what you want
jess yes
luke thats really what you want
jess yes

lorelai that depends, can he swim
luke hes fine hes wet i just, i lost it, you know you were right i am in so far over my head that i cant see my own hat
lorelai try turning it around
luke what was i thinking why did i say yes to this
lorelai because you saw a kid in desperate need of some help and you thought you would throw him a line
luke but me, raising a kid i dont even like kids theyre always sticky, you know, like theyve got jam on their hands even if theres no jam in the house, somehow theyve always got jam on their hands im not the right guy to deal with that i have no patience for jam hands
lorelai luke, slow down first of all, jess is seventeen, so i think hes probably past the jam hands stage by now and second of all, you can do this if you want to, you are totally capable but you cant just buy a bed and some sheets and expect the rest to take care of itself that will not work
luke i swear, im gonna kll liz
lorelai hey, liz is not the point anymore liz is not here, jess is here focus on him what are you gonna do about him
babette walks in the back door

lorelai no no no, please tell me you did not go out onto the patio
rory i went out onto the patio
lorelai ugh, rory, thats like accepting the position as the drummer in spinal tap
rory before i knew it, grandma was telling me how important it is for a person to be properly presented to society
lorelai ugh

lorelai agh
rory and how there are flowers
lorelai oh lord
rory and music
lorelai please

lorelai im getting you out of this picks up phone
rory mom, wait
lorelai i swear, there is nothing in the world my mother is better at than getting someone to agree to something that in any other universe, they would never ever consider
rory mom
lorelai i am still convinced she had something to do with lily tomlin doing that movie with john travolta
rory im doing this
lorelai why
rory because you shouldve seen the look on grandmas face when she asked me its just really really important to her
lorelai but  
rory now if its that important to her, and its not that important to me, then why shouldnt i do it
lorelai rory, do you now what a coming out party says
rory it says im a woman now
lorelai no it says, hi, im rory im of good breeding and marriageable age, and i will now parade around in front of young men of similarly good breeding and marriageable age so they can all take a good long look at me
rory youre exaggerating
lorelai no, its like animals being up for bid at the county fair, except sheep dont wear hoop skirts
rory look, i promised, but you dont have to be apart of it if you dont want to
lorelai no, no, if you wanna do it, ill help its just weird this is all the stuff i ran away from i just assumed youd be running with me
rory well, i would, but i heard debutantes dont run something about the heels
lorelai all right then if youre sure, where do we start uh, lets see well, you have a dress you need a dowry, i guess there you go and uh, youll need shoes, hose, gloves, some mice, a dog, a pumpkin whats wrong
rory oh, nothing
lorelai rory
rory oh, no, it just says that your father is supposed to present you at the ceremony
lorelai oh
rory whatever, its no big deal i can get someone else to do it grandpa probably
lorelai rory
rory or taylor
lorelai okay
rory or the cable guy looked pretty friendly last week maybe he has a tux
lorelai hand me the phone
rory i was kidding about the cable guy what are you doing
lorelai dials phone look missy, there are plenty of things that should weird you out about coming out, but inviting your father shouldnt be one of them
operator the number you have dialed  
lorelai umm, wra   gum wrapper
rory hes not going to come
lorelai you dont know until you ask
rory mom
lorelai dials new number look, we call, we ask, theres no harm trust me cable guys not going anywhere
christopher hello
lorelai ugh, hi where the hell are you
christoper boston
lorelai boston walks into living room
christopher yeah, boston baked beans, cream pie, tea party, strangler
lorelai oh, that boston
christopher and you
lorelai me
christopher where are you
lorelai helsinki
christopher really
lorelai yeah, i finally got the girl band together and after a week opening stateside, we headed across the atlantic and now were huge with the nordic set
christopher its good to hear from you we havent talked in awhile
lorelai you couldve called too, you know or do you have one of those special phones that only receives calls
christopher well, i figured you had a lot going on what with the engagement and the canceling of the engagement hows that going, by the way
lorelai no, still canceled
christopher you okay
lorelai good and im even better when im not talking about it
christopher moving on then
lorelai so i have some shocking news rorys coming out
christopher out of what
lorelai coming out white dresses, gloves, curtsies
christopher stop it
lorelai i swear to god
christopher i cant believe youre letting her do it
lorelai oh, well, i wasnt about to let her use my method of getting out of it
christopher this is crazy
lorelai shes doing it as a favor to my mom, theres no talking her out of it
christopher well, did you tell her about barbara hutton, doris duke, gloria vanderbilt
lorelai yes, and shes perfectly willing to marry cary grant, get offed by her crazy butler and start designing blue jeans as soon as the ball ends
christopher well, okay, if thats what she wants
lorelai now comes the reason for my phone call
christopher all your regular 976 numbers are busy
lorelai now i know this is totally not your thing, but as you will remember, part of the whole coming out process involves the girls being escorted around the dance floor by their dads
christopher ah
lorelai now, i know you would rather sit through "endless love" than ever be apart of this scene again but this is very important to your daughter and she has never asked you for anything, and although no ones keeping track, it would seem that your constant nonpresence in her life and your lack of ever showing up when you say youre going to or calling when you say youre going to or basically doing anything when you say youre going to would tend to indicate that you owe her, big time now before you say no, i want you to take a minute and remember you have a great daughter who needs you and she has a mother who will hunt you down like a halfpriced kate spade purse if you disappoint her
christopher okay, im there
lorelai by there, do you mean the daughters of the american revolution annual debutante ball
christopher yes
lorelai oh chris, please dont make this promise if you cant
christopher i wouldnt miss it
lorelai its next weekend
christopher ill clear my schedule
lorelai you swear
christopher oh wait, next weekend
lorelai christopher
christopher im kidding, i will definitely be there
lorelai okay, and in exchange for that i will refrain from saying the ten things that came to mind for making fun of your schedule
christopher thanks
lorelai bye
christopher bye
rory walks into living room
lorelai hey little debbie, your dad is definitely gonna be there
rory youre kidding
lorelai no, hes gonna walk you down the stairs, and turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy, and announce that rory gilmore is officially open for business

miss patty now, keep counting in your heads look each other in the eye dean, are you leading
dean i have no idea
miss patty okay okay, stop stop stop now remember, one of the most important things in ballroom dancing is to remember to spot, otherwise youre gonna get dizzy so, what you wanna do is you wanna pick out something to focus on i usually like to find a lonely seaman then when turning, whip your head around and find your spot again spins around hello sailor, hello sailor, hello sailor now you try it
dean youve gotta be kidding me
rory i think you can do it without the hello sailor part

lorelai so hows it going
rory actually, im not very good
dean yeah, which is really holding me back because im a natural
lorelai well, maybe you just need a glittery glove and a really freaky face
rory at one point miss patty thought dean was gonna get hurt, she made me sit in the corner and watch
lorelai hey nobody puts baby in the corner
christopher its not your fault ballroom dancing is a wonderfully sexist thing any woman can do it, all she needs is a strong male lead no offense dean he pulls lorelai towards him, but she stumbles

lorelai really
christopher yeah i like that at the end of the day, i feel like ive done something ive earned something
lorelai well, i think thats really great
christopher only took me ten years and several failed business ventures to figure out what i wanted
lorelai which is
christopher not my parents life
lorelai ah

lorelai they just sit helplessly and wait for some young strong man to come by and assist them they dont step in puddles, they dont step over puddles they cant even look at puddles they actually need to be blindfolded and thrown in a sack and carried over puddles
rory isnt there a moratorium on how long ladies are supposed to talk
lorelai uhh, no now repeat after me, i am completely helpless
christopher okay, so you pull the left side through the back loop and tug a little bit on both sides, and you my friend, might just be mistaken for a gentleman or a waiter
dean so, how do you know how to do this
christopher seventeen cotillions, a dozen debutante balls, and a brief but scarring experiment with the children of the american revolution
lorelai where you wore nothing but the bowtie
christopher a good idea on conception, but the sudden snowstorm instantly dampened the effect

richard do you know what im going through at work
emily your whole life isnt that damn company, richard
richard i have told you what im going through, but somehow, you just dont seem to hear it you dont listen to me you dont listen to anybody
emily that is not true
richard it is true isnt it true has she ever listened to a word youve said
lorelai oh, well, hey, people listen in different ways, right i mean, some people listen with their ears, and some people listen with not their ears, but that doesnt mean some actual listening hasnt happened in some form
emily i have listened to you richard i know exactly what is going on with you
richard really, what
emily you lost an account
lorelai what
richard no, i didnt lose an account i was taken off an account i was taken off an account that i personally brought into this company ten years ago

richard i have been in charge of that account for ten years
emily how can you be so angry yes, they took you off that account, but they also gave you a promotion
richard oh, emily
emily you said they moved you upstairs to a larger office and gave you a new title and a better parking space
richard emily, dammit, i am being phased out
emily you are not
richard what do you mean im not i know whether im being phased out i invented phased out for this company dont you think i did the exact same thing to alan parker
emily alan parker retired
richard alan parker was phased out i now have his office, i now have his parking space do you know what happens from here i lose more accounts, slowly but surely they will put a younger man on them with me to be trained by the best and then, one day theyll call and ask me to let that young man take a meeting without me, just to see how fast hes learning, and then suddenly that young man is given that account and this happens again and again and again until im nothing, but a symbolic figurehead that they roll out for banquets and group pictures and then one day, emily, i will be asked to leave
emily well, so what
richard excuse me
lorelai dad, i dont think mom meant exactly
emily so what if thats true
lorelai or maybe she did
emily there are other options
richard i dont want other options i want to get up every morning and put on my suit, and go to my office, and do my work, like ive done everyday for the past thirty years thats what i want to do thats the only thing i want to do

christopher thanks i will
lorelai you know, um, i happened to be looking through some old maps this afternoon and i couldnt help but notice that boston is not that far away
christopher aw, you needed a map to tell you that
lorelai i also noticed that that, um, i84 is a very good road solid, paved
christopher uh huh
lorelai and i put this information in my pretty little head, i was thinking, if you wanted to maybe drop by occasionally, it wouldnt be too difficult
christopher you realize ill be driving the volvo
lorelai actually, im coming around to the vovlo
christopher really
lorelai yes i think its sort of a catholic schoolgirl thing, you know its conservative on the outside, bad on the inside
christopher i like that image
lorelai ive also heard the i84 can get jammed on the weekends
christopher it can
lorelai so if you wanted to stay a little longer, just to avoid the traffic, it might be a good idea i mean, rory would definitely love it, and i wouldnt mind either christopher that is a tempting offer, but i really have to get back
lorelai to work
christopher to workand to someone
lorelai oh
christopher i know i shouldve told you
lorelai oh no, thats fine thats totally your business

opening credits
cut to lukes diner
lorelai and luke are sitting at a table talking
luke so, the first thing you and sookie would do is incorporate
lorelai wow sounds so big time
luke not really it just means youre a single business entity youll both be officers and shareholders, and youll get to make up a name for your company and everything
lorelai mmm, im terrible at coming up with names when we first bought out house, rory and i wanted to name it, you know, like jefferson named his place monticello, but all we could come up with is the crap shack
luke nice
jess walks over with a coffeepot
jess coffee
lorelai oh, yeah, thanks how are you jess
jess well, im not bleeding or anything
lorelai well, then its gonna be a good day, huh
jess yeah its 745
luke so
jess so do you want me to go to school or do you want to openly defy child labor laws
luke go stay out of trouble
jess guess that means calling off the chickie run down at the salt flax
luke out jess leaves
lorelai wow, so much love
luke so, you guys have a site in mind for the inn
lorelai yes
luke great, where
lorelai youve seen pictures of it the rachel property
luke oh, right
lorelai sorry
luke its okay
lorelai i just meant, rachel took the pictures, and the pictures kind of got us into the place, so we started calling it the rachel property cause it made sense at the time and then it became a habit but now out of respect for you, im gonna stop repeatedly using her name and uh, think of another name to call it lets see, the crap shacks taken
luke its okay call it what you want
lorelai so, who taught you about all this business stuff your dad
luke please my dad didnt even have a checking account until i finally got taller then he was he bought this land with cash from working construction, built this place himself didnt have a bookkeeper, an accountant, or anything
lorelai wow, so you had no one showing you the ropes
luke nope, i figured i had to just dive in on my own, fail if thats my destiny, and forget what the experts say
lorelai that is exactly my philosophy exactly except im not diving in on my own, im diving in with sookie, and, uh, failure is not even a choice of destinies, and im consulting any expert who will listen to me otherwise, its identical
luke well, i should be getting going you gonna write this meal off
lorelai why
luke oh, we talked business you gotta be thinking about these things
lorelai no, i mean, why im not paying for it luke sighs exactly
luke youre gonna do fine
cut to independence inn kitchen
lorelai and sookie are talking in the kitchen as michel walks in
lorelai it shouldnt be too flashy
sookie how about something historical, like the paul revere
lorelai oh, that could work
michel what could work
lorelai were thinking up names for the inn were gonna open
sookie i mean, if you want simple, something like the country rose
lorelai thats pretty good
sookie we could line the front path with multicolored roses
lorelai or  or the inn by the hollow kind of long
sookie no, but nice

michel or the outhouse go international
sookie go back in your hole
michel or the inn heading for bankruptcy kind of long, but nice
sookie you who have no dreams rain on those who do
michel i say this because i care about you its risky what you are doing most new businesses go down within two years
lorelai i say if we go down after two years, itll be the most exciting two years of our lives
sookie same here boredom stinks
michel fine, proceed blindly hands lorelai some papers here, it came in ten minutes ago it does not involve the independence inn, therefore delivering it was beyond my official obligations, so i am taking an extra long lunch break leaves

emily lorelai, your daughters being impossible she wont pose in an appropriate manner
rory im trying to grandma its just awkward
lorelai let me guess how youre posing her shes in a silly gown on a silly chair with both of her hands raised in some silly way
emily no, just the one hand is raised, and none of its silly
lorelai pick a simpler pose, mom
emily this is the simplest, and it wasnt my choice
lorelai and your choice is
emily i wanted the swan to sit regally aside rorys throne
lorelai swan throne
emily oh, now you have a problem with swans and thrones
lorelai because swans and thrones scream one thing mom, siegfried and roy
emily who

emily i suppose youd just have her sitting in a chair reading a book
lorelai now that sounds great
emily oh, be serious
lorelai i am thats a completely natural pose for rory and a painting of her reading thats gonna be hung in dads study seems just crazy enough to work
emily well, maybe its not such a bad idea
lorelai give it a try and let her lower her arm
emily rory, you can lower your arm
rory thanks
swan honks
emily i think hes just hungry were going to lose the swan

mia and michel enter the kitchen
mia i wanted to put it on the front desk but i think it might be a tad short
michel well, we could get a carpenter to build up a base and raise it up two inches and then it would be perfect
mia great idea hey, i got that, every word
michel yes
mia oh, oh, im so proud
michel and mia leave
sookie so you gonna tell her now or later

lorelai, rory, and mia walk down the street towards miss pattys

lorelai he did not he said there would be severe consequences
rory mia, what time is it are we late
mia i hope so
lorelai mia
mia im sorry, but its been two years since ive gotten to go to a town meeting and i want some controversy
lorelai sees luke in front of the diner, locking up
lorelai aha
luke geez dont sneak up on me like that
lorelai yeah, boy, i was lucky you had your phasers on stun, huh
rory well, at least were not late lukes never late
luke actually, were 2 minutes early
rory ha we should get a prize for being on time
lorelai hey luke, lets go back to the diner and get some pie as our reward for being on time
luke then youd be late
lorelai a funny conundrum, but i want pie
luke youre harassing me now
lorelai im not harassing you were your groupies in high voice oh luke, youre so dreamy, be my guy
rory in high voice no, be my guy
luke im bringing up the need for more police protection at this thing
they walk into the town meeting, which has already started
mia i think were late
luke whats going on here
taylor uh, nothing
luke meeting was supposed to start at eight taylor, its a minute to eight
taylor well
miss patty oh, you might as well be honest with him taylor
lorelai be honest with him about what
taylor well, if you must know, there was a special issue that the business community had to deal with first, so we decided to start early tonight
luke im in the business community and i wasnt told about it taylor
taylor all right, fine you werent invited luke
luke and why is that
mia controversy
taylor you werent invited because we are dealing with the jess situation
luke the jess situation
lorelai uh oh if this was the wild west, wed be pushing the horse aside and diving into the water trough right about now
luke dammit taylor
miss patty luke, honey, calm down
taylor after all, this is all your doing if you hadnt so cavalierly dismissed the issue, we wouldnt have had to do this i lost business because of what your hooligan nephew did
luke how was business lost taylor if you had to open a little late that day, your customers just came back later
taylor not so when mrs lanahan couldnt buy her head of lettuce that morning for her lunch, she drove straight to woodbury to buy lettuce from a competing market isnt that right mrs lanahan mrs lanahan
lorelai you really shouldnt be driving anymore
taylor word has it that she was telling other doose market shoppers that woodbury lettuce is crisper thats business flying out the door
luke okay fine how much is a head of lettuce, a buck oh, lets go crazy, give me five heads
taylor this goes well beyond a head of lettuce, young man the charges against your nephew are numerous he stole the save the bridge money
luke he gave that back
taylor he stole a gnome from babettes garden
luke pierpont was also returned
miss patty he hooted one of my dance classes
fran he took a garden hose from my yard
man my son said he set off the fire alarms at school last week
lorelai i heard he controls the weather and wrote the screenplay to glitter
bootsy i think its time for me to pipe up here
luke oh yeah, thatll be good
bootsy i have every right to pipe in here luke im a local entrepreneur
luke you took over your fathers newsstand bootsy, it doesnt make you an entrepreneur
bootsy and you took over your old mans hardware store
luke and turned it into a diner
bootsy big whoop who cant fry an egg
taylor lets keep it moving here boys, huh
bootsy i never liked the look of that kid from the second i saw him
luke unbelievable
bootsy excuse me, but ive got the floor
luke you dont have the floor
bootsy im standing, arent i
luke well i was standing first which means i have the floor and im not giving it to you
taylor what is with you too
bootsy this goes way beyond the jess matter taylor lukes been on my case since the first grade when he wrongfully accused me of sabotaging a clay imprint that he made of his hand
lorelai ooh think hard, was he dressed like sulu
luke no one cares about the stupid clay hand bootsy and you stomped on it while it was drying three kids saw you
bootsy no i didnt
luke you did too
bootsy no i didnt
taylor boys, please the bottom line here is that there is a consensus among townspeople who are in agreement that stars hollow was a better place before jess got here
luke so this half of the room gets the tar, and the other half gets the feathers
taylor well, there hasnt been any talk of tar and feathers although
luke look, ive lived in this town my entire life, longer than most everybody here
bootsy i beg to differ im five weeks older than you, that means ive been here five weeks longer
luke ive never bothered anyone ive kept to myself and ive done the best i could i pay my taxes, and i help people when i can i havent pitched in on the decorative pageantry town stuff because it all seems insane to me, but i dont get in the way of that stuff either
taylor whats your point, luke
lorelai his point isdo you mind
luke be my guest
lorelai his point is, that if theres a problem
luke and im not saying theres a problem
lorelai right, hes not saying there is a problem, but if there it, give him time to deal with it before you storm his diner with torches and pitchforks
luke right what im dealing with, being a problem, that i dont necessarily agree that i even have
lorelai right
taylor i didnt get that last part
lorelai lay off him because what youre all doing stinks
luke im done here im done with all of you oh, and i was gonna stay open later in case anyone wanted to eat after the meeting forget that leaves
bootsy his turkey burgers are very dry
cut to outside miss pattys
lorelai, rory and mia walk out of the town meeting
mia well, i must say that was quite exciting
lorelai a little disturbing i think the whole town needs a field trip
rory do you think lukes okay
lorelai i think he will be he just needs to cool off a little
rory hey, im gonna go check on dean hes been scraping that outline off the cement for two days now
lorelai good idea theres nothing like your face on his to make the cleaning process go faster
rory shes all yours mia
mia ill take her
lorelai bye hon rory leaves
mia oh, i am just having the most wonderful time and i am so proud of you and rory you both have just come so far
lorelai yeah, we have um, mia, i need to talk to you about something
mia of course what is it, honey
lorelai well, um, its really hard, and uh, i shouldve brought it up ages ago, but sookie and i are thinking of making a change
mia a change
lorelai were going to open our own inn
mia oh
lorelai i mean, weve talked about it for a long time and it seems like the time is right andoh mia, i love the independence inn and sookie loves it too and we both love you so much
mia i know
lorelai but it just feels like something we need to do andyou hate me
mia no i dont
lorelai im letting you down im walking out im being ungrateful
mia lorelai, stop do you think i was naïve enough to think that youd work for me forever you and sookie have more talent for this business than i do and im very good youre going to open an incredible place, and if you dont let me help you in any way i can, then ill be very mad
lorelai of course, we need your help wed be lost without your help
mia good i was just wondering, whats the time frame for this big move
lorelai well, were waiting for this perfect location to free up, thats all thats delaying us but i promise youll have plenty of notice and ill be there to find our replacements and train them
mia oh yes, thats very sweet of you, but im wondering if you could possibly make it sooner rather than later
lorelai what
mia well, you see, your leaving gives me the perfect excuse to finally sell the place
lorelai sell the place
mia oh, i get offers all the time, lucrative ones, but i never even considered it because   oh, of course i love the inn, but i just couldnt do that to you and now that you have this big change coming up in your life, it might be time for one in mine
lorelai oh good, uh, good then it all works out good
mia actually, its very good
lorelai okay wellgood
cut to independence inn
lorelai sits at a table in the lobby organizing placecards as sookie walks over to her with a piece of paper
lorelai hey
sookie hey so im working on the menu for the duncan wedding
lorelai i cant read that
sookie i know i had it all typed up nice and neat to begin with but on the drive into work, i got an inspiration i just started crossing it out and writing in the new stuff and it aint easy writing and driving, andi cant read that what is that  cumin
lorelai sookie, i cant read that either
sookie oh ill just get you a new one hey, how did your talk with mia go
lorelai fine good she took it like you said she would  classy
sookie she is classy good, good thats a relief it is a relief right i mean, you said she took it good
lorelai yes she did
sookie but you look upset
lorelai shes gonna sell the inn
sookie youre kidding
lorelai no, she said she gets offers and she thinks this might be kind of fortuitous timing for her
sookie well, great, so everybody wins, thats good look happy okay, this does not look happy
lorelai i just dont understand how she can do this
sookie whats the big deal
lorelai the big deal isshes not gonna sell it to another mia its gonna be a big chain, and theyll come marching in with their business models and their corporate approved architects and designers, and change everything around and remodel, and the place will lose all its personality and charm
sookie well, i hope they dont do that, but hey, our place is gonna be full of charm
lorelai so you dont care what happens to this place
sookie of course i do, but its not up to me i mean, i cant control that the only thing we can control is what our inns gonna be like
lorelai i guess
sookie you guess what
lorelai well see
sookie well see what
lorelai its just a little short sided to just write off this place when we havent even bought frans yet and, hey, we dont know if we will
lorelai walks to the dining room, sookie follows her
sookie we dont why wouldnt we lorelai is this about frans life expectancy because i
lorelai no sookie, its about the fact that we havent even looked at any other places and we dont know if thats necessarily the right one and we have to be very practical about this
sookie but its the perfect location we all said so
lorelai well, you cant get emotionally attached to any of our decisions about the inn this is business youve got to stay detached
sookie but we are all so not detached butokay, do you have another location in mind
lorelai not really
sookie do you wanna look for a new location
lorelai oh, yeah, like i have all this time to go looking for other locations
sookie well, i dont know should we try to buy this place
lorelai aha this place is five times what we can afford
sookie so what do we do
lorelai i dont know its on hold, i guess
sookie well, its been on hold for years we were moving forward
lorelai yes, well, im looking at the economy right now and im thinking, i dont know if the timings good
sookie okay, thats not fair because i dont know anything about the economy
lorelai oh, well then good thing you hooked up with me because its not looking good
sookie okay, what happened
lorelai what do you mean, what happened
sookie we had a vision, we had a plan youre the one that got this whole ball rolling again, and i jumped on the ball, and then we were rolling on the ball together and then you hopped off the ball, and im still on the ball and im confused, cause i see it, and i see our vision, and you saw it too up until today
lorelai well, i know you would like things to be simple and straightforward but unfortunately things are more complicated
sookie okay, thats why wed be partners if something gets too heavy for the one person, the other ones there to pick up the slack
lorelai yes, well thats great in theory, but i gotta tell you, my back is aching from all the extra slack im taking up
sookie what did i do thats so wrong
lorelai lets not get into this stuff
sookie no, get into it
lorelai well, youre not the most reliable person in the world or the most punctual
sookie youve always known that about me
lorelai yes, but now, getting into business, its not so cute it could hurt us i mean, you were late for the fran meeting, youre constantly changing every menu you ever set, even after youve started making it
sookie i dont believe this before it was kudos to me for my attention to detail i was the maestro
lorelai thats fine for an established place like the independence, but you do that stuff at our place, it could wipe us out profit margins in a new business are slim, sookie
sookie just stop just stop now youre talking down to me
lorelai im not talking down to you, im trying to explain
sookie yes you are yes you are, and i dont know why you are, but i dont want to start crying in front of you because itll just give you one more thing to point at to say, look, shes too emotional and shes too weak for me to go into business with, so im leaving and ill see you tomorrow, if i can remember to show up

luke they run in the back, throw up, pass out and then smack their head on the floor
lorelai what

mia mm hmm
emily and what did you expect to say to me when i did come

lorelai how do you like that mouth
rory um, its not very mouthlike
lorelai oh, i think it works
rory its tilted to the side
lorelai yeah, no, it was intentional it gives her a unique expression
rory like she had a stroke
lorelai fine, ill just use the mrs potato head lips
rory no, forget it, leave strokemouth its not like were gonna win this anyway
lorelai whoa, bad attitude
rory mom, face it that is the single most incredible snowman i have ever seen looks at a man working on an elaborate snow sculpture
lorelai im sorry, that snowman is way over the top, way too showy its screaming im incredible, im special, look at me
rory kind of the point of a snowmanbuilding contest
lorelai hmm, i hate this man with every fiber of my being
rory he looks nice
lorelai hes a ringer
rory how do you figure
lorelai someone recruited him, promised him a handsome sum, financed his theatrical snowman accoutrements, so he could snatch victory away from a deserving local in order to bag the contest prize for himself
rory seems a little elaborate considering that the prize is a set of new us quarters
lorelai oh, were ignoring him now so, what are we gonna do on your school break
rory a lot of nothing
lorelai sounds good
rory plus some homework
lorelai and a lot of movies
rory oh, we have to rent godfather 3 on dvd
lorelai youre kidding
rory in the audio commentary, coppola actually defends casting sofia
lorelai now that is fatherly love whats all this homework you have to do
rory just stuff for the paper
lorelai what why
rory because paris wants the first issue back to be a double issue, so we have to prep over break and she says the news never sleeps
lorelai what about paris, does she ever sleep
rory i think she periodically makes a whirring noise and then just shuts down
lorelai well, you cant work the whole time
rory i wont, i promise oh my god
lorelai what
rory hes power buffing
lorelai aw, now that is just wrong
rory were competing against the michelangelo of snow

lorelai oh, it was our pleasure
paris did you notice the anachronisms
lorelai the what
paris the period discrepancies they were pretty blatant i mean, forget that the nineteenth century didnt include recessed lighting or the fossil watch that your server was wearing, but water in that period would not have been served with cubed ice
lorelai right
paris and your servers are wearing nylon blend shirts, and nylon was invented by a scientist at dupont in the 1920s it shattered the illusion
lorelai floggings will be administered
richard so there we are, its a beautiful moonlit prague night, and were strolling across the charles bridge when we come across this group of kids blasting this song by that  oh, that awful woman who is she the tall bony one, married to the deceased mustachioed congressman
rory cher
emily thats the one
lorelai the year of do you believe in life after love
rory a difficult time for all of us
michel i like that song
richard well, i was appalled prague has played host to some of the greatest composers in history mozart named a symphony after it, for heavens sake so what did i do
emily i have tried so hard to forget this
richard i stood beside them and their boombox and i hummed mozarts prague symphony as loud as i could starts humming
lorelai a bizarro battle of the bands
taylor and did it work
richard well, they quickly packed up and went their way
emily but then he kept on humming the mozart he wouldnt stop
richard well, at that point i was hoping for some gullible tourists to drop money at my feet
emily and two of them did
richard and i kept it
taylor you know, this might be the most interesting conversation ive ever had with an insurance man
richard aww, im hurt
taylor im sorry richard what i meant was that
richard no, what you meant was that people in the insurance industry are drones well i agree they are a dull, dull lot, and i am glad to be rid of them
lorelai rid of them
taylor oh, are you retired richard
richard well, uh
emily of course hes not richard richard
richard actually, i am
cut to bedroom
later that evening, lorelai and rory are in their room at the inn getting ready for bed
lorelai ah, its always nice to end a big festive meal with a big festive pall hanging over the room
rory most people didnt notice anything
lorelai i guess bootsy singing hotel california accompanied by spoons drew peoples attention away
rory did grandma and grandpa say a word to each other the rest of the night
lorelai no
rory why didnt he tell anyone
lorelai im sorry, are you asking me to interpret my parents motives
rory my mistake so which bed do you want
lorelai take the one by the window
rory okay pulls back blanket mom
lorelai what honey
rory you put the picture of the ugly baby in my bed
lorelai i didnt, i swear that ugly baby is stalking us run away
rory poor baby, its not his fault
lorelai i think its a she
rory poor baby, you picked the wrong parents hey, have you heard from dad recently
lorelai what dad  your dad
rory yeah, my dad
lorelai why
rory because hes my dad, and he usually checks in this time of year and he hasnt checked in yet i mean, i know hes probably busy with sherry and the new apartment andwhat
lorelai there may have been a call
rory there may have been you dont remember
lorelai well things have been so hectic, you know, with the bracebridge dinner, and um, building a snowwoman, and planning the ugly baby gag, that took time
rory mom
lorelai yes, he called he called, he called, he called and invited you, and its not too late to go he called and invited you, so there you go im sorry i didnt tell you, so there
rory he invited me over
lorelai yes, are you deaf
rory no, im just trying to separate the gist from the ubububububah
lorelai well, the gist is he invited you, okay
rory why didnt he invite me himself
lorelai because hes pretending to be considerate by running it past me first
rory was he maybe not pretending to be considerate, and actually being considerate
lorelai maybe but i wouldnt put it past him to be inconsiderate the guy doesnt have the greatest track record
rory why didnt you tell me this hes probably waiting for my answer, and holding off making plans
lorelai because i have dibs on this time of year with you, not him me and yes, he acknowledged that, and that was cool and all, but still  it stinks because he put me in a very difficult position because we were supposed to watch a lot of movies and make fun of godfather 3, and the thing that i really, really hate about this isis the idea of you not hanging out with me because youre hanging out there with your stupid stepmother
rory youre calling sherry my stepmother
lorelai well, she practically is
rory youre wigging
lorelai there is something wrong with that woman
rory you dont even know her
lorelai you think im overreacting
rory i think youre jealous of sherry
lorelai ha, im not jealous of sherry
rory but i understand  your territory has been threatened
lorelai excuse me
rory but relax, there are ways to work through situations like this  compromises can be struck
lorelai oh, what are you saying
rory well, you know, i can still call you mom, and ill call her mommy sherry
lorelai dont be mean
rory and we can split up holidays evenly like, ill be with you on labor day
lorelai okay
rory her on memorial day
lorelai enough
rory ill have to find out about her religion though to see how chanukah will factor into this, unless you want to convert to judaism and then take over chanukah for yourself
lorelai i get the point i overreacted please stop
rory you totally overreacted god
lorelai so do you think youre gonna go and stay with them
rory ill have to think about it
lorelai do you have to think about it because you know that its killing me not to know whether youre going or not and you want to torture me like that
rory nope, i just dont know if i want to do it
lorelai oh
rory it was nice of him to ask though
lorelai it was very nice
rory cause we are rooting for dad
lorelai we are rooting for him it was a very nice thing that christopher offered i was being a little possessive
rory and insanely jealous of his pretty girlfriend
lorelai well, i wanna know if shes good enough for him
rory me too
lorelai so there was an altruistic streak to my madness
rory well go with that
theres a knock at the door lorelai answers, emily is there
emily i need a new room
lorelai what
emily i cant stay in that room
lorelai there are no other rooms, mom
emily well, then ill go home

emily well, im not going back to that room
lorelai im guessing you and dad had it out about the job thing
emily we havent even spoken since dinner im so upset, i wouldnt know where to begin and i couldnt take being around him anymore what he did is inexcusable not letting me know he left his job  as if it didnt affect me
lorelai aw mom, try to calm down here, take this bed, and rory and i will share
emily im just a burden
lorelai youre not a burden, mom
emily well, okay, thank you can i use the mirror in the bathroom for a second

richard i want to talk to you, please i dont need to remind you about how ive been feeling at work, and my frustration just built to the point whereagain, you know this so, i arranged to meet the ceo yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors id heard floating around so i met with floyd we shook hands, had coffee, then i started telling him about how unhappy id become i detailed all my years with the company, all the travel id done, all the weekends i put in, the sacrifices id made, including time with my family, for the firm and the more i talked, the angrier i became, and then suddenly i heard myself resign, just like that floyd was stunned id never seen floyd stunned i enjoyed seeing floyd stunned so i finished my coffee and i walked out of that office, and i couldnt believe what id just done id resigned, quit i believe i even used a little profanity in the process but you know what emily i was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest i noticed floyds secretary staring at me, and i realized it was because i was smiling well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time i was  i was happy
emily and you chose not to tell me your own wife
richard oh emily, i know ive done nothing but disappoint you these past few months, what with how isolated ive become and all the social engagements ive made you cancel, and all the friendships ive jeopardized and you like order, you like lists, you like to know where youre going or whats coming you like all things planned and then suddenly i impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop well, i couldnt face disappointing you again i couldnt face telling you that id spoiled the plan not now, not at this time of year i didnt want to fight, i didnt want to worry, i just wanted to keep being happy im very, very sorry anyhow, um, ive been sitting here going over our financial situation now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, by quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options not a terribly significant amount, but an amount all the same

emily now of course theres a slot open for me and richard and you and rory, but after the two of you thats it no more room for anyone else
lorelai ah
emily yes so if you actually do meet someone someday, i dont know where to put him
lorelai well, maybe we could just dump him at the local pool hall
emily dont be silly
lorelai no, because this is definitely not a conversation for that
emily i looked into expanding into the crypt next door but the family that owns it wouldnt even discuss it with me
rory im getting a little creeped out here
emily so i talked to the head of the cemetery and he suggested that we buy an annex
rory an annex
emily yes
lorelai you know, like an outlet store, it would specialize in the irregular family members
emily so if we do get the annex and you do eventually someday get married
lorelai mom, just say it fat chance will you

lorelai hm, do the florida people know about you because anita bryant left this huge gap that has yet to be filled
richard its important to start the day off correctly, lorelai a grapefruit is brain food it has vitamin c and folic acid and it helps with your digestion it really is a terrific fruit
lorelai i feel like youre about to break into song
richard im serious about this lorelai
lorelai i know you are but i still dont like grapefruit
richard well, there are many things in life that we dont like, but the benefits they bring us far outweigh the temporary discomforts we have to endure
lorelai okay hold on a sec

lorelai hey, i need a grapefruit
luke what
lorelai yeah before my pancakes this morning i need half a grapefruit, uh, preferably one that tastes like a donut
luke i dont have grapefruit
lorelai how can you not have grapefruit
luke ive never had grapefruit
lorelai i need a grapefr  listen, i have my father with me all day, and so far theres been no major drama or yelling or ugliness but there will be if i dont somehow find a way to get half a grapefruit for breakfast this morning
luke i could go next door to dooses and buy a grapefruit
lorelai i would be eternally grateful
luke ill be right back
lorelai thank you
lorelai walks back to the table
lorelai okay, the grapefruit is coming
richard oh, you wont be sorry

richard very sensible

cut to chilton
rory is at her locker she slams it shut and finds paris standing there
rory okay, you have got to stop doing that
paris so ive been doing some research on the oppenheimer award, and ive noticed something all of the winning schools had an extremely strong human interest story on page one
rory okay
paris and i think thats what we need i mean, weve got the teen issues down, weve got a decent oped and political page, but human interest thats what were missing
rory ideas
paris yes
rory do tell
paris according to the papers, theres been a huge increase in the number of families fleeing the major cities in favor of small towns hundreds of thousands of city slicking yuppies carting the trophy wife and the asthmatic kids off to small towns in search of the simple life milk a cow, pet a pig, find yourself, all that kind of crap
rory interesting
paris yeah, and i thought about it theres a romantic aspect to small towns white picket fences, low crime rate, smaller classrooms, better tomatoes it all seems perfect
rory but
paris but nothing is perfect, nothing is safe, nothing is ever what it seems and then it hit me  our story we are going to blow the lid off the seedy underbelly of small town life, starting with yours
rory stars hollows
paris yes
rory you are going to uncover the seedy underbelly of stars hollow
paris yes
rory paris, stars hollow doesnt have a seedy underbelly we dont even have a meter maid
paris look, you may be blind to it because you live there, but trust me, its there and its ugly and im going to find it ill meet you out front after school
rory i cant today
paris why not are you hiding something
rory no i promised my mom that i would help her with something
paris well, help her tomorrow we have work to do
rory paris
paris hey, this could be our chance to nail this thing now i have a hunch that theres a story here and a good one, and im going to find it i was even going to share a byline with you on it, but if you wanna bail out, thats fine ill just do it myself
rory but 
paris am i meeting you or not
rory i dont think youre gonna find anything

taylor there she is, the girl of the moment
rory me
taylor you, young lady, are my hero
rory why is that taylor
taylor because in this day and age when the kids are willy nilly with their clothes and hair and morals, it is heartwarming to see a sensible girl like you still exists a girl who has the gumption and the guts to stand up and say, why are we allowing this trash out where all our children can see it
kirk and a few selected adults also

taylor you told me to put that movie where the kids couldnt see it
paris you did
rory well, yeah, but i just meant to put it on a higher shelf, not to get fabric involved
taylor oh, this is much better than a higher shelf now all the movies that we deem objectionable will be safely hidden from the eyes of the children plus, itll make the adults think twice before they go back there
rory no, i did not mean to do this what are you doing
paris this is it
rory this is what
paris our story censorship in a small town, its perfect

richard walks through the front door
richard well, we had it thoroughly checked we found a little problem with the windshield wipers dean is there now adjusting them but once that is taken care of, i dont see any reason why, with proper insurance of course, why you cant have that car

richard excuse me
lorelai dad, this is my house in my town, where i live my life
richard well, thank you for the geography lesson
lorelai no, im  in the thirty two years weve known each other, have i once come to your work and criticized the way you handled your clients
richard i dont remember you coming to my work at all
lorelai well, have i passed judgment on your breakfast habits or your clothing choices
richard i was offering opinions
lorelai well, dont i dont want your opinions, especially not in front of my employees and not in front of my friends
richard i guess you cant take constructive criticism
lorelai nothing that came out of your mouth today might, in any universe visited by kirk or spock, be construed as constructive
richard i beg to differ
lorelai and this is absolutely the last time you come into my house and overrule my word
richard what are you talking about

lorelai you dont have to think it looks safe i have to think it looks safe god, why cant i make you hear what im saying
richard oh, i hear exactly what youre saying
lorelai you came here not as a guest but as the judgment police, you kept your uniform on the whole time, and you know what, it comes off now
richard lower your voice
lorelai no i am a grown woman and you will treat me the way you treat people who have invited you to their house or you will not be invited again
richard invited
lorelai yes
richard dont you think i know why you invited me here
lorelai because  
richard because your mother asked you too she called you up and said i was driving her crazy, and would you please take me off her hands for one day so she can get some peace isnt that true
lorelai no
richard you have never once invited me to your house lorelai, never and i can hardly point to an event that would prompt you to do so except my recent employment situation
lorelai okay dad, mom did call me but  
richard you know, i never thought about retirement i never thought about what i would do or what i would be once i wasnt working i never once imagined that i would go from being a productive member of the human race to a decrepit old drone sitting at the club at three in the afternoon drinking brandy and playing cards
lorelai aw, dad
richard i am an annoyance to my wife and a burden to my daughter suddenly i realize what it feels like to be obsolete i hope that you never have to learn what that feels like now, if you will excuse me, im afraid ill have to take a rain check on dinner im not very hungry

lorelai its  i dont know im just surprised that youre hanging out with him, thats all
rory why
lorelai he doesnt seem like the nicest kid
rory well, you dont know him
lorelai no, i guess not
rory youre just judging him by that one time that he came over here
lorelai which, by the way, was not a rousing success
rory he had just moved here he was mad at his mom trust me, hes got a really good side to him youll see it eventually
lorelai good, i cant wait

rory youre taking his side
lorelai im not taking sides here, okay im swiss, babe
rory i wasnt off with jess i  jess outbid him
lorelai i know
rory well, the rule is that if one person outbids someone else, then  
lorelai rory, this is not about the rule i know what the rule is this is about dean being concerned that youre hanging out with someone who can get you hurt
rory how could jess get me hurt
lorelai i dont know, hon in the short amount of time hes been here, hes managed to make a lot of enemies
rory im sorry, when did i move to salem
lorelai people are concerned about you, you know youre young and naïve and you think that everyone has some good inside if you give them a chance
rory so youre saying that jess is no good

jess yes
rory you come over you seem to have a very firm grasp of the english language you put together several full sentences, even using a couple of words that contain two or more syllables, and then my mother appears and suddenly we need a thought bubble over your head to understand what youre thinking can you tell me why that is
jess the verbal thing comes and goes
rory i would really appreciate it if you would try to get along with my mom
jess i took the coke
rory i know
jess personally, i think its a little crazy to put lemon in coke but i took it anyhow
rory stop it
jess ooh, stern face
rory look, i went out on a limb for you trying to get my mom to give you the benefit of the doubt, okay so i dont think it would hurt you to try to be nice
jess why
rory why
jess yeah, why
rory because shes my mom and shes a friend of lukes
jess so
rory what do you mean, so
jess so just because shes your mom or lukes friend doesnt mean that i automatically have to get along with her
rory jess, my mother is a great person shes also my best friend in the world, so if you care about me at all, you will take that into consideration and you will be mildly polite to her
jess what makes you think i care about you
rory i dont mean care care, like care i mean if you like me at all   not like like i just meant that if   if you think of me remotely as the sort of person that you could occasionally stand to talk to then you will try to get along with my mom, thats all
jess okay
rory okay
jess i cant guarantee that itll work, but ill try
rory thank you
jess youre welcome i should probably get to work

lorelai you dont have a dog
luke i know, but its wrong
lorelai agreed what else

lorelai ah
luke how can people ask you for a monthly fee for a parking space i mean, theyre making money off your rent, off your utilities, when you use their coinoperated washer and dryer thats cash directly in their pocket and by the way, its not even that good a parking space its out in the open under one of those trees that drops the sap on your car that eats away your paint
lorelai luke
luke whos gonna pay for my car, huh wheres my five hundred dollar, paintkilling tree sap deposit

mary shes right listen to her

lorelai okay um  i dont have any i think its great
luke you do
lorelai yeah, its light and airy its got good windows but not too many so that the sun bakes you in the afternoon
luke thank you
lorelai youre close to work, the price seems good, youre taking the spruce, and its a twoyear lease whats two years

luke yeah, but who knows how long hes gonna be here
lorelai why did something happen
luke no, but you never know

luke and even if he does stay, itll be only for another year, and then hell go off to college or attica or whatever, and itll just be me again
lorelai yeah, but  
luke and stuck with a new apartment, probably with neighbors i hate who are constantly cooking really strong smelling food
lorelai okay, back up here yes, jess may go off somewhere someday, but that doesnt mean you will be alone forever
luke i am not getting a pet
lorelai im talking about a lady friend
luke oh
lorelai a redhot mama
luke okay
lorelai a big, pretty dish of lovin with a spoon made especially for you
luke boy, do i not feel good now
lorelai luke, rachels not the only woman in the world for you youll meet someone, someday  probably at a timberland store, youll ask her out youll pick her up and take her on a patented luke danes night of romance  juice bar followed by the batting cages  and then youll ask her back to your apartment
luke any amount of money if you stop right now
lorelai youll bring her back to your place, lead her upstairs to the apartment door you pause, gaze into her eyes the stage is set, fate is waiting you open the door, and she sees your teeny, tiny apartment one room and no closet space and jess feet sticking up in the air cause you never did get rid of that body
luke stop, please
lorelai and to make matters worse, she spots it the single bed
luke whats wrong with a single bed
lorelai you know what they say
luke no, what do they say
lorelai never, ever date a guy who owns a single bed it means hes not open to a commitment
luke what
lorelai it says theres no room in this life for anybody but me
luke no, it says theres no room in this bed for anyone but me
lorelai okay, see, thats not a whole lot better
luke this discussion is now over
lorelai luke, as long as youre in that apartment, youre gonna have a single bed dont you want the possibility of more come on luke, its time make a move, take a shot, entertain the possibility of a nonunabomber existence what do you say
luke you got a pen im not taking the spruce
lorelai yes, you are

taylor luke, good good goody good good i was just on my way over to the diner to talk to you
luke great go on over, ill meet you there
taylor oh, stop it, this isnt about anything thats gonna make you mad i just have a couple of questions about your application
luke what
taylor your application now i called your bank  
luke what application
taylor your application for the apartment now you have two accounts here 
luke how did you get my application
taylor well, mary gave it to me, of course now im assuming that one of those accounts 
luke why would mary give you my application
taylor because i own the building
luke what when the hell did you buy an apartment building
taylor well, i bought this particular one about two months ago
luke i look at a thousand apartments, i choose yours how is that possible
taylor well, count yourself lucky, you with me as the owner, there is a level of quality control that is sorely lacking in this town for example, at all my properties, we measure the grass before, during, and after mowing to attain a perfect inch and a half height, which is both pleasing to the eye and good for the grass
luke all of your properties
taylor ten in all
luke ten properties what are you, buying up the town
taylor not yet, but someday who knows
luke but why isnt anyone stopping you
taylor because, my friend, people are lazy they dont wanna think about the proper fabric for an awning or the correct historical color for a building they just slap any old thing up on a wall and sleep like babies but soon, hopefully, the city council will put an end to that
luke taylor, you cannot tell people what color to paint their buildings
taylor well, someone has to
luke no, they dont we dont live in a fascist country
taylor oh, this isnt about the fascists who, by the way, had their faults but their parks were spotless
luke i have to get out of here leaves
taylor hey, eh, wait a minute
cut to outside
taylor follows luke down the sidewalk
taylor luke, hold it i still need to talk to you
luke just tear up the application, taylor im not moving
taylor what why
luke cause im the twoinch grass kind of guy
taylor well, thats too bad but i need to talk to you about something else
luke what
taylor im thinking about purchasing the flower shop next to the diner, but we need to talk about that sign of yours
luke what about my sign
taylor well, you have a diner but you never took down the williams hardware sign
luke that was my fathers sign
taylor i understand that you have a sentimental attachment to the sign, but it confuses the tourists
luke back off the sign, taylor
taylor if i buy the building next to that sign, i run the risk of people being so busy trying to figure out if you sell hammers or burgers, that they never notice the nice collectible plate store right next door
luke collectible plates
taylor isnt that a great idea elvis, the beatles, mary poppins, all the greats you can hang them on the wall or you buy a little stand and set them up on the coffee table
luke okay, you need to get away from me now at least a good arm swinging length away
taylor its people like you who keep this town from becoming one of great towns in america, luke
luke arm swinging length
taylor i wouldnt have approved your application anyway

rory ive been all over town looking for it ive been to lanes, ive been to lukes, ive been to the bus stop, ive been to miss pattys, and ive circled stars hollow twice and nothing i have no idea what im going to do
jess its really that big a deal
rory what do you mean
jess i mean, i know its got an ive been pinned bye, bye, birdie kind of implication to it, but it was just a bracelet
rory i dont think dean will see it that way
jess you didnt lose it on purpose
rory i know, but things have been a little weird between us lately and  you couldnt care less
jess oh, yes, i could
rory i just think dean will read something into this
jess should he
rory no
jess i think you should keep looking
rory where
jess anywhere things you lose are usually right in front of your face check the house again
rory ive checked the house
jess its probably just laying in your room somewhere
rory no, i tore that room apart, its not there
jess fine, give up then no biggie deanll just have to get over it
rory ill go look again
jess you do that

lorelai are you okay
cut to rorys bedroom
rory i found it
lorelai what
rory i looked under the bed and there it was i thought i had already looked under the bed, but i dont know, maybe i was too panicked or  i dont know, who cares, i got it
lorelai aw, that is amazing
rory put it on
lorelai hmm
rory make it tight
lorelai oh, im cutting off circulation here, baby

lorelai you took it, didnt you
jess excuse me
lorelai rorys bracelet you had it the whole time
jess no idea what youre talking about
lorelai howd you get it
jess i didnt get anything
lorelai what, did you break into our house, you got all dressed in black and pulled a mission impossible
jess actually, i came down the chimney and pulled a santa claus
lorelai very funny
jess thought a ridiculous accusation deserved a ridiculous response
lorelai so its just a great big ol coincidence that i catch you coming out of rorys room a half an hour before she mysteriously finds the bracelet under her bed
jess guess so
lorelai why would you do this
jess i gotta go
lorelai i mean, i know you hate the world, but i thought you liked rory
jess i didnt do anything
lorelai bull
jess whatever
lorelai oh, dont whatever me, you little jerk you let rory run around completely panicked, thinking she lost her boyfriends bracelet she was miserable, do you understand that
jess i didnt take it
lorelai im sure youre jealous of dean because hes great and rorys madly in love with him, but you taking the bracelet didnt hurt dean, it hurt rory that bracelet is the most precious thing she owns she never takes it off it means everything to her and you stealing it was unbelievably cruel
jess the most precious thing she owns
lorelai yes
jess if its the most precious thing she owns, why did it take her two weeks to figure out it was gone, huh you might wanna reevaluate how madly in love she is i wouldnt start calling him son yet
lorelai get outta here
jess you read my mind
cut to inside lorelais house
lorelai walks in and sits down on the couch theres a knock on the front door, lorelai answers it

lorelai oh, good
they walk into the kitchen
luke i ran into taylor at the market, and i found out he owns the building that apartment was in
lorelai no way
luke that and several others all over town
lorelai that is so weird
luke hes systematically buying up the town hes gonna turn it into taylorville where everyonell wear cardigans and have the same grass height
lorelai luke, do you wanna sit down
luke and then he told me hes gonna buy the building next to the diner, turn it into a plate shop for freaks who dont have enough brain power to collect stamps i lost it
lorelai uh, i cant picture that
luke i walked around in a blind rage i was crazy i bought one of those belgian waffles with the ice cream dipped in chocolate
lorelai you ate that
luke no, i didnt eat it
lorelai of course not
luke im upset, not suicidal
lorelai right
luke i knew i just had to do something, and i had your voice going round and round in my head
lorelai yeah, its kinda like the small world song
luke take a chance, luke make a move, luke cant have a single bed, luke so i bought the building
lorelai you you what
luke i went to the bank and got a cashiers check, signed the papers and i bought the building
lorelai wow
luke i am the buildings owner
lorelai i heard
luke i own the building
lorelai okay, well, dont worry, maybe you can still get out of it you can go back and tell them you lost your mind
luke okay
lorelai or i bet you can sell it to taylor
luke yeah
lorelai so, relax, you can still get out of this
luke okay
lorelai unless you dont wanna get out of it
luke oh no, i wanna get out of this uh, why would i not wanna get out of this
lorelai oh, well, owning that building gives you some options
luke like
lorelai uh, like you could expand lukes if you wanted to
luke yah
lorelai or you could rent it to someone else
luke yah
lorelai someone else who might drive taylor crazy
luke maybe i should think about this
lorelai sure, sleep on it
luke sleep on it, right, right
lorelai you want some tea
luke teas good, sure
lorelai hey luke, um, does jess ever talk to you about rory
luke uh, what do you mean
lorelai i dont know they just  they seem to be thrown together quite a lot lately and i was just trying to figure out if thats a coincidence or  
luke or if theres something going on
lorelai yeah
luke i dont know
lorelai huh
luke jess doesnt exactly confide in me
lorelai right
luke of course, if there was something going on, i think thatd be really great
lorelai you do

paris i got an aminus, okay
rory so
paris what do you mean, so i got an aminus i have never gotten an aminus i just cant focus lately things are so weird at my house my dad finally figured out exactly how much it was gonna cost him to divorce my mom, so now hes back and its bad enough that i wasted all that time crunching the numbers with him, but now that hes back, theyre fighting and redecorating the place is a mess i need help
rory look, i cant tonight, but if youre still freaked out after the quiz on tuesday, i will spend everyday next week helping you prepare for the final, okay

lorelai is in her room unpacking she hears knocking and opens the door to the hallway no ones there, so she opens another door emily walks in wearing a bathrobe
emily how do i look
lorelai like a landlady what is this
emily i got adjoining rooms so we dont have to go out in the hallway to get to each other
lorelai great thinking
emily god, this robe is fabulous how do they get it so soft
lorelai well, i think having about forty other people wear it first is part of the secret
emily oh, stop it so are you all ready for our skin rejuvenating and revitalizing collagen facial and eye treatment
lorelai almost
emily it has vitamin c and plant extracts in it, which is the hottest thing in skin care these days and the eye treatment is supposed to reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines
lorelai okay, no more brochures for you all right, im ready, lets go
emily arent you gonna wear your robe
lorelai what
emily your robe, youre supposed to wear your robe
lorelai oh, well, im sure theyll give me one when i get there
emily but these robes are wonderful
lorelai mom
emily they help you relax
lorelai were late, mom
emily theyre wonderful, relaxing robes
lorelai oh my god
emily and yet, you stand there like its some badge of honor not to put on your robe like everyone else in this place lorelai goes into the bathroom to change this isnt for me, you know, its for you i already have on my robe im already relaxed what are you doing
lorelai from bathroom youre kidding me, right
emily well, hurry up, were gonna be late
lorelai opens bathroom door happy

lorelai so good
facialist okay well, im gonna leave you to sit for a few minutes, so just relax and enjoy, and ill be right back

as the facialist leaves, lorelai closes her eyes emily quietly enters the room and sits down next to lorelai
emily are your feet sweating
lorelai mom
emily those booties make my feet sweat dont they make your feet sweat
lorelai what are you doing in my room
emily magda left me sitting for twenty minutes fine time to take a coffee break
lorelai shes not taking a coffee break your skin is supposed to be absorbing the moisture in your mask in your room
emily lets see whats next on our agenda, shall we stop moving lorelai, youll electrocute yourself ooh, the egyptian mud bath i wonder if the mud bath is one of those things you see in brochures where they wrap you in towels like youre in a cocoon of some sort that might be nice especially if their towels are as good as their robes because i just love these robes i wonder where they get these robes shouldnt be so hard to find the manufacturer i could order a few of them one for me, one for you and one for rory
cut to hallway
lorelai and emily walk down the hallway in their robes
emily i still cant get over it, it really was mud i mean, i know it said mud bath but i didnt really think they meant a real mud bath and the odd thing is i shouldve been more repulsed by it sitting in a tub of hot dirt, which is basically what mud is, shouldve made me ill, and yet i really enjoyed it did yours have twigs mine had twigs, and when i asked the woman about them, she told me they were there because of the healing qualities  
they walk through a door marked quiet room a few seconds later, the door opens and lorelai ushers emily out into the hall
emily what are you doing lorelai, stop it youre pushing me
lorelai bangs on the door, showing emily the quiet room sign, then they walk back into the room
cut to massage room
lorelai and emily are both getting massages
masseur hows the pressure too much
lorelai yup
masseur sorry, ill go lighter
emily your hands are amazing compliment your masseurs hands, lorelai
lorelai oh my god
emily excuse me
lorelai nothing
emily you were muttering under your breath years of experience have taught me that when you do that, its usually about me
lorelai mom, you signed us up for a couples massage
emily so
lorelai a couples massage is for a couple not a couple of people
emily its more efficient this way well both be finished at the same time
lorelai mom, do you know what most people who get these massages do about five minutes after its over they have sx, together, probably while wearing their robes
emily could the two of you excuse us for a moment please thank you the masseurs leave well, that was appalling
lorelai well, that was true
emily youre just determined to spoil this, arent you, lorelai
lorelai why, because i want a quiet, private massage
emily youve been pouting and sulking and sighing
lorelai oh, i have not been sighing
emily rolling your eyes, mumbling
lorelai well, thats how i detox
emily ever since we got here, youve made it your mission to be as miserable as possible
lorelai thats not true
emily its completely true and if you dont care that youre hurting my feelings, maybe you care that youre wasting all your relaxing time acting like a petulant fouryearold
lorelai well, im sorry
emily do you want me to try to get myself another room
lorelai no
emily i saw a supply closet down the hall maybe my masseur could finish me in there
lorelai okay, mom
emily or perhaps i could just roll myself against a stucco wall, eliminate the need for a masseur altogether
lorelai lie down mom, please
emily if you say so lorelai
lorelai yes, mom
emily would you go get the boys, please

emily fraternizing with other men
lorelai oh, what are you talking about
emily i practically cheated on your father
lorelai you did not cheat on dad

lorelai youve danced with other men before
emily not like that, not without your father present
lorelai oh, mom, it was just a dance you were having fun
emily i need to get out of here how hard is it to find a coat
lorelai mom, you didnt do anything wrong
emily i dont know why i let you take me to this chop house in the first place i dont go to chop houses what were you thinking
lorelai need food now
emily and i certainly dont eat at bars hookers eat at bars
lorelai only if they cant get a table
emily youre not funny you knew this whole evening made me uncomfortable and yet you kept pushing
lorelai i was trying to do everything right you manipulated me into taking this trip and still i came you told me i was acting like a teenager, so i tried to be nicer you said you needed to eat, so i made that happen
emily yes, by sitting me at a bar where you practically forced me to engage in inappropriate behavior
lorelai what
emily you let me get sixtyfortied
lorelai you are crazy do you know that we were having dinner, mom, a nice dinner we were talking hell, we were having fun
emily oh, so watching your mother make an ass of herself was fun for you
lorelai god, you know, you dont have any right to complain about this relationship if youre not willing to let your guard down once in awhile and just be normal
emily theres a way for a mother to behave in front of her daughter im sorry if you dont like it, but thats how it is
cut to birch grove spa
lorelai is in her room, packing theres a knock on the door
lorelai come in
emily i called the bellman to get the bags he said it would be around ten minutes
lorelai okay
emily thank you for agreeing to leave early
lorelai no problem
emily i guess this whole thing was a silly idea anyway i dont know why i pushed it we cant even get through a dinner without a fight what was i thinking putting us together for a weekend
lorelai it was a nice thought, mom
emily yes, well, i guess its the thought that counts, isnt it
lorelai you know, if you want, um, i can just bring our bags down i mean, theyre not that heavy, and then we dont have to wait
emily well, that sounds fine why cant we have what you and rory have
lorelai rory and i are different mom
emily were mother and daughter, youre mother and daughter it shouldnt be that different
lorelai its completely different it couldnt be more different
emily but why
lorelai i grew up in a different environment
emily you mean an oppressive environment
lorelai no, mom, i mean a different environment and plus, i was so young when i had rory
emily so because i waited until i was grown and married, i cant have a relationship with my daughter
lorelai no
emily well, then, why
lorelai rory and i are best friends, mom we are best friends first and mother and daughter second, and you and i are mother and daughter always
emily i wasnt taught to be best friends with my daughter
lorelai i know
emily i was taught to be a role model for my daughter
lorelai i know that, too
emily i did what i thought was right i did what i thought i had to do to protect you, and because of this we have no relationship
lorelai oh, mom, we have a relationship
emily we do what what is our relationship
lorelai well, we  
emily exactly
lorelai maybe an intense weekend together was not the best idea for us maybe we need to start with something simpler
emily like what, a brisk walk around the block
lorelai no, i hate exercise
emily oh, well, as long as you find this amusing
lorelai mom, come on there has to be something else something small
emily like what where are you going lorelai, you just dont walk out on a person thats rude thats a robe
lorelai yes, this is my robe and i want you to go into your room and get your robe and then, exactly at the same time, we are gonna shove these robes in our suitcases and we are gonna walk out that door and leave with them
emily thats stealing
lorelai yes, it is
emily you want me to steal a robe thats how were going to bond
lorelai mom, you love this robe youve talked about nothing else except this robe since we got here, so this robe will be symbolic of our trip together
emily but thats crazy as soon as they check the rooms, theyre going to know the robes are gone and then theyre going to charge our credit card
lorelai well, how do you know
emily because thats what the little tag on the hanger says
lorelai well, the little tag on the hanger could be right, or the little tag on the hanger could just be there trying to scare us away from trying either way, whether we get away with it or not, its something we did, you and i
emily youre serious
lorelai i am folding this robe up
emily lorelai
lorelai i am putting this robe in my bag
emily thats lunacy
lorelai i am zipping up the bag that contains the robe
emily i have a perfectly good robe at home

babette sexy its sexy squash
taylor sexy or not, i demand that this man produce his permit post haste
proprietor got it right here
taylor mm hmm, just what i thought this is not the proper permit for this kind of business this is a type twentyfour b, otherwise known as a cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk permit this is not valid for your business
proprietor whyd you say it twice
taylor hmm
babette you said cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk
lorelai its repetitive
rory and redundant
lorelai its repetitive
rory and redundant
lorelai we certainly are entertaining, mac
rory indubitably, tosh
taylor its not redundant its three separate things its a cart, a kiosk, and a mechanical hybrid referred to as a cartslashkiosk, hence cart, kiosk, cart/kiosk
babette he did it again
kirk hes been stressed lately his store is deserted
taylor ill make it simple this is for businesses that roll in in the morning and roll out at night emphasis on the word roll rolling businesses, businesses that roll
proprietor but i carry my tables out at night
taylor but youre supposed to roll them, rapunzel, and carrying isnt rolling, is it i mean, did anyone hear the word rolling come out of his mouth check the transcript, i think youll find one word missing rolling
miss patty transcript
lorelai yeah, taylor, this isnt charlie rose
babette hes losing his marbles
andrew its just a personal vendetta
kirk his store is deserted
miss patty i think that we should end the meeting right here, taylor
taylor wait a second, wait a second you there, when lady godiva here wanted to be town troubadour over you, i stood by your side why arent you backing me now
troubadour cause you left me twistin for a long time before you did, taylor, and it didnt feel good i even wrote a song about the experience
lorelai oh, i heard it its called "taylor left me twistin"
rory oh yeah, its really good
troubadour you think because im having a little trouble with the chorus taylor left me twistin, he set my eyes a mistin im just not sure if it has that thing, though, you know
lorelai oh, no, i love that part i actually thought that maybe at the end you could do more about the sweater well talk
miss patty im gonna wrap this up
taylor now, patty, how would you feel if this guy decided to open the longhaired freak school of dance or the longhaired freak diner, luke or the longhaired freak bookstore its not good, right
miss patty all right, everybody who agrees that we would not feel good about that, say aye

taylor you might as well know, luke we dont wanna go to louies funeral
luke what
andrew we all hated louie
luke oh, come on, thats not true
taylor he always had a scowl on his face, not a kind word for anybody he would light those hideous cigars, blow smoke in peoples faces and then spit after each puff
sy he was disgusting
andrew and mean
kirk he kicked my dog when i was a kid
sy he hit on my wife repeatedly
kirk toto was always different after that
sy my wife was much affected as well
kirk id toss her something to fetch and shed start to run after it and halfway there shed forget what she was doing
sy she never enjoyed her soap operas the same after that
kirk shed just lie down and go to sleep
luke this is an exaggeration
bert were not exaggerating we threw a big party when he left town
sy i made love to my life that night like i never have
kirk my toto barked a happy bark, then quietly stopped breathing she was old
luke i dont believe this
andrew come on, luke you knew the guy
luke this man was my uncle, okay, and a war veteran he deserves a veterans funeral, but hey, if you guys are too lazy to show up, then  
taylor hes the lazy one never once did he participate in a town function in fact, when we reenactors gathered, hed throw things at us
sy and not soft things, hard things
bert rocks, and small tools
luke okay, ive heard enough
sy and he got meaner as he got older never married, never had kids

michel oh, this will much amuse you
sookie color samples for the big ceramic stands
lorelai big ceramic stands for what

lorelai sookie, honey, i need you stop staring and streaming for one second we need to talk
michel please, please do not talk her out of these things i do not want to die without seeing midgets dancing with a mushroom
lorelai stay out of this

sookie what is it honey
lorelai the danger of emilyworld is that you dont always know youre in it, when actually you are
sookie aw, not this emilyworld stuff again
lorelai sookie, have you run the numbers on any of this what is this costing you
sookie i dont know the full cost but your mother is getting me fifty percent off everything she is so connected
lorelai okay, but fifty percent off a load of money is still half a load of money you dont have half a load to spend
sookie well, if i scrimp i can afford a quarter load
lorelai thats still too much
sookie well, your mother said shed chip in a little
lorelai sookie, that is way, way, way inappropriate
sookie i didnt take her up on it but it was nice
lorelai sookie, this isnt you, the midgets and the mushrooms and god knows what else and it isnt jackson either
sookie what do you mean
lorelai we talked
sookie you and jackson talked
lorelai im sorry but he came to me all upset, and i love you sookie and i love him too and it just seemed like it was time for me to meddle
sookie he was upset
lorelai he was pretty upset
sookie why didnt he just talk to me
lorelai because hes jackson, he wants you to be happy and to give you everything you want so what it comes down to is is this what you want
sookie well, maybe the midgets are a little over the top and the mushrooms   oh my god, its all sounding so silly now
lorelai youre coming out of it, keep going
sookie no, no, its not what i want we were supposed to keep this nice and simple god, we had it all worked out
lorelai so go back

cut to funeral home
luke is waiting impatiently near a casket as lorelai walks in
lorelai there you are what 
luke it wont close
lorelai what
luke the lid
lorelai to what sees casket oh, hello   louie
luke thats louie
lorelai nice tan so, now, you say the lid wont close
luke yes, the lid wont close
lorelai did you buy the right size
luke of course i bought the right size
funeral director its the model we recommend for those of medium height and weight
luke and hes of medium height and weight
lorelai so then why wont it close
luke because of the stuff
lorelai what stuff
luke the stuff he left a list of stuff he wanted buried with him
funeral director its not uncommon
luke its a very long list his fishing reel, bowling trophy, a flask, his antique dueling pistols, his copy of shermans memoirs
lorelai so is all the stuff in there now
luke yes, it is i shoved it in the best i could but now it wont close which defeats the entire purpose of having a damn casket in the first place
lorelai may i
luke give it a shot
lorelai tries to push the lid close, but it pops back up
lorelai whoa
luke the football signed by johnny unitas gives it that bounce
lorelai what if we moved the gas mask and the pith helmet down towards the feet
luke that end already has every baseball card he ever bought, thousands of them
lorelai oh, bungee cord no um, what if we got some people from the office here, you know, accounting or whatever, to sit on the lid and then we could latch it do you have anybody you could spring  hm im out of ideas
luke so am i you know what, to hell with this to hell with this
lorelai luke, now come on
luke i cant deal with this anymore
lorelai well, it has to be dealt with
luke no, it doesnt its not as if he deserves my help or my respect
lorelai the man was your uncle
luke he was a jerk
lorelai dont say that
luke no, no, taylor and the guys were right i was cutting louie slack out of respect for my dad, but the man was rotten and mean and selfish all his life for gods sake, hes even selfish in death other people wouldve loved to have had those baseball cards i wouldve loved to have those baseball cards hes got lou gehrigs rookie card, joe dimaggio, willie mays, tons of others but no my uncle, king tut, has to take all of them to the afterlife with him
funeral director sir, your voice
luke im done, ive had it from now on, its just the bare minimum and thats it dig a big hole and just dump the casket in unlatched if stuff falls out, fine just pile on enough dirt and make sure nothings showing leaves
lorelai im assuming that wouldnt be appropriate either
funeral director no
lorelai i didnt think so
cut to lukes diner
jess is walking around the tables refilling coffee
customer young man, wheres the young lady weve heard so much about whos using those delightful old diner phrases to place peoples orders it sounds so fun could you point her out for us
jess no walks to counter thats everyone ill be upstairs
rory thanks for doing the very least you could possibly do
jess youre welcome
luke enters the diner
lorelai luke, there you are i was worried
luke yeah, sorry, i shouldve called thanks for covering again thisll be the last time, i promise
lorelai its okay where were you
luke well, at first, i walked around a bunch, ya know, just trying to clear my head saw a lot of hartford and what a cesspool
lorelai well, youre not a city man
luke then i calmed down after awhile and i figured dumping louies body in an open grave with all his stuff probably would be a little cold
lorelai just a tad
luke so i got a yellow pages and i found the big and tall casket shop in hartford
lorelai youre kidding
luke nope, i found a casket that would fit my hundred and sixty pound uncle and his hundred and forty pounds of stuff, got the lid to shut the first time we tried it, so the funerals on as scheduled
lorelai good
luke i still dont know why im doing this
lorelai youre doing it for your dad
luke yeah, i guess although hes dead so hed never know if i was doing it any different
lorelai he knows hes got the big luke picture screen on twenty four hours a day and he watches and smiles and youre doing it cause youre you
luke hey, im gonna change real fast and you can retire from your diner career forever
lorelai oh no, its fun i came up with some new diner phrases do you know what a lucky duck cluck is

emily she claims to have changed her mind on all the things we had planned
lorelai well, maybe she did
emily no, she didnt i know whats behind this that is, whos behind this
lorelai mom, it was getting to be too much for her and too much for her fiancé
emily i knew it
lorelai mom, these are not wealthy people, do you understand that theyre saving for a home and your midgets were dancing between them and their dreams
emily you say midgets like its so absurd
lorelai do you hear yourself

emily what, come on
lorelai you werent planning sookies wedding
emily well, then, whose wedding was i planning

emily i wasnt planning your wedding, lorelai
lorelai right
emily the wedding i was planning was for sookie the mushrooms and colors, they all seemed like fun a little crazy, just like she is it definitely was not for you
lorelai okay mom
emily i know that in a million years, you would never let me plan your wedding i gave up on that dream a long time ago yours was going to be a russian winter theme the romanovs

lorelai wow
emily you hate the idea
lorelai no, no, i just 
emily you just hate it
lorelai no, it just doesnt seem like me
emily yes, well, it wouldve been beautiful

luke that aint me, is it
lorelai what are you talking about
luke what taylor said about me being like louie, a loner, never being married and stuff i mean, i am getting crankier as i get older, hes not so far off
lorelai you are not your uncle i mean, would louie ever build someone a chuppah, or help fix things around someones house without being asked, or make a special coffee cake with balloons for a girls sixteenth birthday
luke rory told you about that
lorelai yes and would louie have taken in his sisters kid without hesitating and without asking for anything in return
luke no one wouldve trusted louie with their kid he probably wouldve forgotten to feed him or something
lorelai you get my point
luke yeah, i get it he hears drumming whats that he sees one of the reenactors walking onto the cemetery is that andrew
lorelai i believe it is
the other reenactors arrive
luke thats all of them
the reenactors start doing their salute
luke thanks
lorelai its what your dad wanted
luke yeah oh, i know louie wouldve hated this
lorelai thats just a fringe benefit
cut to sidewalk
luke and lorelai are walking toward the diner
lorelai do you think hes in heaven
luke i hope so, just so my dad can kick his butt around the place

rory so you did do a little something
jess i unlocked the door
rory so that people could come in here and put this together nice

jess yeah, well maybe i can knock over a liquor store while everyone else is planting those stupid trees

sy so, like i say, its halloween, right, and were lucky louie doesnt have razor wire around his yard, you know how he is so finally one of the neighborhood kids, he gets all courageous and he goes sauntering up to the door and he goes trick or treat louie finally throws the door open, looks at him and says, did you get a reeses cup tonight and the kid looks in his bag and he says, yes sir, i did so louie grabs it, says thank you very much, then slams the door in his face
lorelai im sorry i never met him
luke he was colorful
kirk i never trick or treated again
miss patty so one day im at the post office, im in line when louie just about knocks me over and he cuts in line i said, louie, theres a line so he says, kiss my butt and i said, you mind your manners and he says, please kiss my butt and drops his pants

lorelai thats what kills me this is selfinflicted im a masochist i might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it
rory that diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile, trust me
lorelai i guess, unless i turn into john nash and start drooling on people
rory hey, youre graduating
lorelai i know
rory no, youre graduating there is gonna be a ceremony
lorelai oh, i dont know its community college
rory well, community colleges have ceremonies
lorelai my community college doesnt even have a lawn, they wont necessarily have a ceremony
rory they must did you ask
lorelai no well, now that you mention it, i think someone said something about some cheesy ceremony for my business class
rory when is it
lorelai i dont know  next thursday or something
rory thats great, you have to do it
lorelai i dont know
rory you have to do it
lorelai really
rory yes youve never been apart of an actual graduation ceremony
lorelai i know thats because my stupid conservative high school wouldnt let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time
rory dont be gross
lorelai do you really think i should do it
rory yes youve worked hard for this, youve earned it
lorelai i guess
rory come on, you know that deep down you really want to do this
lorelai well, ill admit, ive always wanted to wear one of those gowns
rory and the hat
lorelai for the tassel cause you know my thing for fringe
rory and they call out your name and people clap and you get your diploma
lorelai oh, and then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other very symbolic, very dramatic
rory thats it, youre doing it
lorelai all right, if you insist
rory okay, who do you wanna invite
lorelai i dont know, you
rory and
lorelai thats cool with me
rory sookie and jackson
lorelai aw, thatll be fun
rory okay and grandma and grandpa

rory come on, its your graduation they should be there
lorelai forget it
rory but 
lorelai they wont want to be there
rory of course they will
lorelai rory, i was supposed to graduate from high school go to vassar marry a yale man and get myself a proper nickname like babe or bunny or shih tzu
rory yes but 
lorelai instead, i got pregnant i didnt finish high school, i didnt marry your father and i ended up in a career that apparently jessica hahn would think was beneath her
rory thats not  
lorelai i humiliated them the two proudest people in the world and i humiliated them i spoiled their plans i took their fine upbringing in a world of comfort and opportunity and i threw it in their faces i broke their hearts and theyll never forgive me i guess i cant expect them to
rory maybe youre wrong about how they feel about all this it was a long time ago
lorelai rory, i dont want them to go itll just hurt them  and me, okay
rory okay you should get back to your studying
lorelai fine oh, great

dean yeah, i knew it
rory you shoot pigeons
dean clay pigeons
lorelai when you hit them, does blood come out
dean theyre clay
rory and why do you like to do this
dean i dont know my dad shot skeet when he was my age and so he wants to pass the tradition down
lorelai what if you accidentally hit a real pigeon
rory yeah, does that count
dean thats never happened
lorelai what if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon, does that count
rory yeah, does that count
dean ive only done this once

rory i just wanted to talk to you about something in person
emily well, come in, come in
emily leads rory to a lavishly set table
rory wow
emily its an english tea service one the advantages of our having an english maid that, and the fact that she speaks english
rory you didnt have to do this
emily but its tea time and i wanted to  oh no beatrice, i told you to doily line the plates
rory you dont have to doily line the plates
richard calls from another room hello
emily were in the dining room
richard oh, oh, rory, youre already here
rory youre out of breath
richard i ran over from the office
rory oh, you didnt have to run
richard well, your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us that certainly justifies a run
emily all right, everybody, sit, sit pour the tea, beatrice
rory um, actually, beatrice, could you hold off on pouring the tea for just a minute thank you very much grandma, grandpa, i would like to propose an idea to you now, you can go for it or not, its entirely up to you, but i would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset
emily we wont get upset
rory and that you will try to keep an open mind
emily all right
rory and that you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond
emily to richard shes been hanging around you far too much
richard rory, we accept your terms please proceed
rory thank you first, let me start by saying that mom doesnt know that im here shed probably be pretty mad if she knew that i was, but i feel that this is important as you know, moms been going to business school at the community college out here for three years now
emily i believe shes mentioned it
rory well, shes doing very well and shes finishing up actually, shes graduating thursday, and theres going to be a ceremony and i think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there it may not seem like it would, but its true
emily well, if it would mean so much to her then why didnt she invite us herself
rory because she didnt think youd wanna go and i get that, but i think its a mistake i had a school thing once, and i wasnt sure if mom would want to go so i didnt invite her it was my kindergarten "salute to vegetables" pageant and i was broccoli and i did a tap dance with a guy that was playing beets and the entire number i was just thinking, "moms not here" and it was my fault that she wasnt there and, well, it was kind of a life lesson for me now, if the thought of going to moms graduation upsets you or makes you unhappy or uncomfortable in any way, then, please, dont go because this is an important night for mom and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances pulls an envelope out of her backpack those are the tickets its thursday, 7pm its indoors so weathers not an issue you can use them or not, no hard feelings, do what you feel is best and if you dont mind, i would really appreciate it if you would keep this conversation between the three of us thats all i have to say, thanks very much for your patience now, i believe i have time for a scone before my bus leaves
emily beatrice, the tea, please
rory emily, these look delicious so, richard, how was your day today
